## Highlights

- Possibilism maintains that fictional stories represent possible worlds and that fictional entities represent possible entities that constitute these fictional worlds. Fictional possibilism is subtly introduced in Aristotle’s Poetics where he argues that fictional entities represent possible entities which are introduced by authors to present their thoughts about the way things could have been in the world.[4] However, possibilism was advanced by David Lewis who argues that fictional stories present accounts of different possible ways the world could be. Fictional entities are the actual inhabitants  of their relevant worlds, and they have the same ontological status in their relevant worlds as actual objects have in our actual world.
- creationism/artefactualism: Saul Kripke describes fictional entities as “abstract entities which exists in virtue of the activities of human beings.”
