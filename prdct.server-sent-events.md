## Comparison

### vs [[prdct.websocket]]

- "Built-in support for reconnection"
- You can only have six concurrent open SSE connections per browser at any one time. This can be especially painful when you want to open multiple tabs with SSE connections. See '[Server-Sent Events and browser limits](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18584525/server-sent-events-and-browser-limits)' for more information and workaround suggestions.
