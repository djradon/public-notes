## Abstract

- Conceptual modeling is of great importance not only to Information Systems and Software Engineering, but also to Simulation Engineering. It is concerned with identifying, analyzing and describing the essen- tial concepts and constraints of a real-world domain with the help of a (diagrammatic) modeling language that is based on a set of basic modeling concepts (forming a metamodel). In this tutorial, we introduce the ontologically well-founded conceptual modeling language Onto-UML and show how to use it for making conceptual simulation models as the basis of model-driven simulation engineering.

## Highlights

### MODEL-DRIVEN SOFTWARE AND SIMULATION ENGINEERING

Two most important viewpoints:
1. information modeling, which is concerned with the state structure of the domain;
2. process modeling, which is concerned with the dynamics of the domain.

- It is natural to apply the general methodology of Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) also to sim-
ulation engineering.
- Unfortunately, the results obtained in the conceptual modeling field of IS&SE have largely been
ignored in M&S. Still today, conceptual modeling is often confused with design modeling in
M&S.
- A conceptual model is a solution-independent description of a problem domain expressed in a
well-defined (diagrammatic) modeling language.
- In model-driven simulation engineering, we first make a conceptual system model, from which
we derive a (platform-independent) simulation design model, which is then transformed into one
or more (platform-specific) simulation models.
- A conceptual modeling language is a representation of a meta-conceptualization of a viewpoint
of the real world. A system conceptualization, which exists in the mind of the modeler and con-
tains a number of system concepts, instantiates a meta-conceptualization. It is represented in the
form of a conceptual system model expressed in the conceptual modeling language representing
the meta-conceptualization.
- We propose to use improved variants of UML Class Diagrams and BPMN, which are based on a
foundational ontology, for conceptual information and process modeling
