Intuition 1:

There are four kinds of entities required for reasoning about processes -- activities, activity occurrences, timepoints, and objects.

Intuition 2:

Activities may have multiple occurrences, or there may exist activities that do not occur at all.

Intuition 3:

Timepoints are linearly ordered, forwards into the future, and backwards into the past.

Intuition 4:

Activity occurrences and objects are associated with unique timepoints that mark the begin and end of the occurrence or object.
