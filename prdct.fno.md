  - "we present a data model, specification, and ontology to semantically declare and describe functions independently of the used technology. This way, we can declare and use actionable events in semantic applications, without restricting ourselves to programming language-dependent implementations. "
- There exist many specifications handling Web services, both non-semantically (e.g., WSDL and WADL) and semantically (e.g., [[prdct.owl-s]] and [[prdct.hydra]]) 1. These specifications target different facets (e.g., HTTP-based vs SOAP-based access, defining RESTful APIs, etc.), but have in common that they define Web ser- vices.
