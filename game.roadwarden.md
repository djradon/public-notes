## Philosophy

- ""Very early on, in the first design document, I had this idea that it's not that everyone is going to pay you for completing quests, but rather that completing quests is going to, for example, unlock access to a new shelter," he says.

- "what keeps me thinking about Moral Anxiety's game [is] its deftness and intimacy, the way it rediscovers and earths concepts other games have elevated into systems, using things as small as coins to express character and setting, while lending a mystique to magic that can be surprisingly lacking in videogames."
- "it rescues me from the often suffocating role of world-conquering/saving level-up machine bestowed on me by other RPGs, and turns me into a fellow traveller - a friend at the table"
