## Quotes

@franz-kafka: “But sleep? On a night like this? What an idea! Just think how many thoughts a blanket smothers while one lies alone in bed, and how many unhappy dreams it keeps warm.”

## Famous Nocturnal Writers

@chatgpt.4o

Several well-known writers have famously worked at night, often finding the quiet and isolation conducive to creativity. Here are a few examples:

1. **Franz Kafka**:
   - Kafka is perhaps the most famous example of a writer who worked at night. He had a demanding day job as an insurance clerk, so he wrote late into the night, often sacrificing sleep. His nocturnal writing contributed to the surreal, dream-like quality of his works.

2. **Sylvia Plath**:
   - Plath wrote much of her poetry during late-night hours, especially during periods of emotional intensity. The quiet and solitude of night allowed her to focus on her work.

3. **Marcel Proust**:
   - Proust was known for his unusual writing habits, which included working at night. His chronic asthma and sensitive disposition led him to create in a darkened, quiet room, often working late into the night to craft his monumental work, **In Search of Lost Time**.

4. **F. Scott Fitzgerald**:
   - Fitzgerald, known for his wild social life, also worked at night. His late-night writing sessions were often fueled by alcohol, and much of **The Great Gatsby** was written during these hours.

5. **T.S. Eliot**:
   - Although Eliot had a demanding job during the day, he often composed his poetry at night. The complex, modernist poetry he is known for, such as **The Waste Land**, was partly shaped by his late-night reflections.

6. **George Sand**:
   - The French writer George Sand (pen name of Amantine Lucile Aurore Dupin) also worked at night. She found the night to be the most peaceful time for uninterrupted creative work, particularly in her country home.

These authors, and many others, found inspiration and productivity in the late hours, often creating their most famous works in the quiet of the night.
