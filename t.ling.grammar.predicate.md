- Predicates can be one verb or verb phrase (simple predicate), two or more verbs joined with a conjunction (compound predicate), or even all the words in the sentence that give more information about the subject (complete predicate)

## [[c.question]]

- [-] Is a simple predicate still a relation? I've seen where people say that a unary relation is basically a reflexive/recursive relationship, like "i slapped myself", as opposed to a property like, "i slept".

## [[c.Idea]]

- https://www.ling.upenn.edu/~beatrice/syntax-textbook/box-thematic.html
  - It is often convenient to identify arguments of (Fregean) predicates in terms of the following **thematic roles,** which are illustrated below.

    agent
    cause
    instrument
    experiencer
    recipient
    location
    path
    goal
    measure
