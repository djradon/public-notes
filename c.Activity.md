[[p.equivalentPredicate]] 
: [[p.did]]

- almost unnecessary, I've been using bullet points as an uncategorized default for activity logging
  - BUT, if you started a new category of stuff, you need a way to re-declare activity items.

## Specifications

[[c.domain]]
: [[c.actor]]
: [[c.project]]

  - only an actor can undertake activity, but things can be said to have activity that contain actors, like products, places; 
    - I guess mechanical devices are actors; for that matter, the sun could be an actor even though you wouldn't really call it a device
