We assume that roles cannot live autonomously: they exist in the system in view of the interaction. We follow the ontological model for roles proposed in [6], and brought inside the object-oriented paradigm in [4], which is characterized by three aspects: (1) Foundation: a role must always be associated with the institution it belongs to and with its player; (2) Definitional dependence: the definition of the role must be given inside the definition of the institution it belongs to; (3) Institutional empowerment: the actions defined for the role in the definition of the institution have access to the state of the institution and of the other roles, thus, they are called powers; instead, the actions that a player must offer for playing a role are called requirements. The agents that will be the role players become able to perform protocol actions, that are powers offered by a specific role and whose execution affect the social state. On the other hand, they need to satisfy the related requirements: specifically, in order to play a role an agent needs to have the capabilities of satisfying the related commitments â€“ capabilities which can be internal of the agent or supplied as powers as well.
