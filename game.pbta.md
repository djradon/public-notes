  - "While there are rules for combat and magic [in D&D], pretty much everything else is done on a case-by-case basis. In a PbtA game, there is a finite set of moves, both unique moves for specific characters and basic moves everyone gets. The moves define everything that the rules cover; if a character wants to do something that isn’t a move, they can do it without rolling."
  - "when the GM makes a move, it happens, no die roll necessary"
  - PbtA games offer a range of mechanics which define how the PCs interact

    - "the reason Apocalypse World uses authoritative voice in the GM’s section is because without the Agendas and Principles laid out for the GM, the game doesn’t actually work very well. Games that use the PbtA framework well are narrow; that’s the main reason that Apocalypse World and Dungeon World and all the others are published as different games as opposed to splatbooks for some theoretical core system. Part of that narrowness is that these games will only work for primarily story-driven games. What the Agendas and Principles tell the GM is not how to run RPGs, they tell the GM how to run this RPG, and that’s an important distinction."
