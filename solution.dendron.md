### Snippets

- [ ] [[skos.definition]]

## Product ideas

- links can use aliases, so instead of seeing [\[solution.dendron]] I can just see [\[Dendron]] or maybe even Dendron^ in my editor
- flexible capitalization settings
  - I don't want predicate notes to be capitalized
- inclusion macros:
  - all blocks
    - match "tags" or links
  - all notes
    - match tags, links, hierarchy (does this exist already? it does for sub-notes)
- ![[Multi Repo Auto save Commit Push|pi.multi-repo-auto-save-commit-push]]
- pretty-ref setting per reference 
  - usePrettyRefs is impossible course
  - would be nice to have a single-line prettyref 
- use "title" instead of hierarchy (this already happens on same page, see altLabel)

## interesting github issues

## unreported issues

- 10/2/21 can't @-mention anymore?
- preview capitalizes lvl-4 headings
- does "move note" always fail the first time?
- too much newlines added to .gitignore ^hETGc7F9cXEZ
- sometime can't choose "references" vault for new note creation
  - "distroid-issue-13-digital-gardens" allows
  - "article.distroid-issue-13-digital-gardens" doesn't
  - 2021-09-25 this actually seems to be a consistent mis-labelling of one of the options -- two options can get repeated and you can usualy figure out which one is mislabelled
