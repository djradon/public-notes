## Concepts

### References

### Snippets

- [ ] [[skos.definition]]

## Product ideas

- links can use aliases, so instead of seeing [\[solution.dendron]] I can just see [\[Dendron]] or maybe even Dendron^ in my editor
- flexible capitalization settings
  - I don't want predicate notes to be capitalized

## interesting github issues

- [Leave a trace on source note when using selectionExtract · Issue #737 · dendronhq/dendron](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/737)

## unreported issues

- does "move note" always fail the first time?
- too much newlines added to .gitignore ^hETGc7F9cXEZ
- sometime can't choose "references" vault for new note creation
  - "distroid-issue-13-digital-gardens" allows
  - "article.distroid-issue-13-digital-gardens" doesn't
  - 2021-09-25 this actually seems to be a consistent mis-labelling of one of the options -- two options can get repeated and you can usualy figure out which one is mislabelled
