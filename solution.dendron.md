## Product ideas

- links can use aliases, so instead of seeing [\[solutions.dendron]] I can just see [\[Dendron]] or maybe even Dendron^ in my editor
- flexible capitalization settings
  - I don't want predicate notes to be capitalized

## interesting github issues

- [Leave a trace on source note when using selectionExtract · Issue #737 · dendronhq/dendron](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/737)

## unreported issues

- does "move note" always fail the first time?
- too much newlines added to .gitignore ^hETGc7F9cXEZ
- sometime can't choose "references" vault for new note creation
  - "distroid-issue-13-digital-gardens" allows
  - "article.distroid-issue-13-digital-gardens" doesn't
  - 

## todo

- [x] [set keyboard shortcuts for selectionExtract](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/ad270a7d-2aed-4273-8319-eb6536e38b29.html)
