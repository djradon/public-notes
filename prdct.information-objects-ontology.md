## Description

An ontology of information objects, encodings and realizations, as a plugin to DOLCE-Ultralite (reusing mainly the `dul:expresses` and `dul:realizes` relations from it). Several patterns are contained inside this ontology:

-   encodings of information entities
-   kinds of realizations (gestural motions, depictions, digital, multimedia, speech, etc.)
-   combinatorial relations between information objects
-   relations between formal expressions and generalized expressions (lexicalizations, formalizations)
-   relations between formal expressions and their assignments in formal semantics
-   relations between information objects and schemata (data structures, KOS, etc.)
-   authorship
-   kinds of linguistic objects
-   copies, reproductions, etc.
-   cultural combination of information objects (reuse, mixing, metaphorical blending).
