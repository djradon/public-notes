## Mood

We recognize three Moods in verbs:

- **Indicative** is a statement: I walk quickly.
- **Imperative** is a command: Walk to the store!
- **Subjunctive** is a prediction or possibility. In modern English we need to use a modal to indicate a subjunctive: I might walk to the store later. I could walk to the store.
