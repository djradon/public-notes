- [[p.hasType]]
  - multi-word verbs
    - [[p.hasType]]
      - phrasal verbs (main verb + adverb particle)
        - often have meanings which we cannot easily guess from their individual parts
        - object can come before or after the particle if the object is not a pronoun
      - prepositional verbs
        - an idiomatic expression that combines a verb and a preposition to make a new verb with a distinct meaning
        - always have an object
      - phrasal-prepositional verbs
        - e.g.
          - catch up with
          - come up against
  - “Implicit object” (IO) is a name for what happens when a verb we normally consider transitive appears without an object:"
    - [[p.hasSource]] https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1715&context=pwpl
    - "often argued that the IO needs to be recoverable from the context" but clearly not. 
    - "recoverability is a matter of degree. At a minimum, one simply knows that an object exists; at a maximum, one knows exactly what it is; and there is plenty of middle ground in between."
    - "manner verbs from result verbs and propose that result verbs
do not allow IOs." 
      - [[p.hasSource]] Rappaport Hovav and Levin (1998); Rappaport Hovav (2008)
      - but whether IOs are allowed isn't easy to distinguish

    - Inflected forms (singular/ plural or present/ past tense) ~~or derived forms (using affixes to make new words)~~
    - paradigm or declension
      - " For the English verb 'walk', the paradigm consists of 'walk', 'walks', 'walking', and 'walked'"

## Mood

We recognize three Moods in verbs:

- **Indicative** is a statement: I walk quickly.
- **Imperative** is a command: Walk to the store!
- **Subjunctive** is a prediction or possibility. In modern English we need to use a modal to indicate a subjunctive: I might walk to the store later. I could walk to the store.
