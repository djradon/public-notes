## Highlights

- "the quadtree is built as a Merkle tree, meaning that every non-leaf node of the tree is assigned a cryptographic hash value, which is calculated by hashing the child nodes of the corresponding node. Thereby, a single changed object somewhere in the overall region is recognized by a change of the treeâ€™s root hash. Starting from the root, it is possible to track the change down to the single leaf node that changed."
