- intrinsic non-sortal?
  - @chatgpt: "Aspects are a specific type of non-sortal that represent intrinsic properties or features of individuals that can be perceived and measured but do not provide a principle of identity on their own. They characterize individuals but do not define what the individuals fundamentally are."
