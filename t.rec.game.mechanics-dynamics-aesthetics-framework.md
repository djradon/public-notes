-   Mechanics are the base components of the game - its rules, every basic action the player can take in the game, the [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm "Algorithm") and data structures in the [game engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_engine "Game engine") etc.
-   Dynamics are the run-time behavior of the mechanics acting on player input and "cooperating" with other mechanics.
-   Aesthetics are the emotional responses evoked in the player.
    -   including:
        - **Sensation** (_Game as sense-pleasure_): Player enjoys memorable audio-visual effects.
        -   **Fantasy** (_Game as make-believe_): Imaginary world.
        -   **Narrative** (_Game as drama_): A story that drives the player to keep coming back
        -   **Challenge** (_Game as obstacle course_): Urge to master something. Boosts a game's replayability.
        -   **Fellowship** (_Game as social framework_): A community where the player is an active part of it. Almost exclusive for multiplayer games.
        -   **Discovery** (_Game as uncharted territory_): Urge to explore game world.
        -   **Expression** (_Game as self-discovery_): Own creativity. For example, creating character resembling player's own avatar.
        -   **Submission** (_Game as pastime_): Connection to the game, as a whole, despite constraints.
        -   **Competition**
