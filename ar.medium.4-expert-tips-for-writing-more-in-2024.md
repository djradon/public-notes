## Highlights

-   **Confront the Mirror Monster,** the voice in your head that says things like “no one will ever care about what you’re writing.” One tactic: Don’t reread what you’ve written until you’ve finished a Bad First Draft. Novelist [Eileen Pollack](https://medium.com/u/eb253931aee9?source=post_page---user_mention--d1db9f4dcca3--------------------------------) calls this a “[zero draft](https://humanparts.medium.com/how-to-finally-finish-your-creative-projects-5b4386f1498d?sk=v2%2Fb0c43eb9-7cb9-45cc-9bcd-33f010cbb9db),” which I like because it sounds attainable. Just get _something_ down, and then you can improve it.
-   **Stop downhill.** Stop writing when you’re excited to keep going, not when you’re stuck — so when you reopen that doc, you have a clear next step.
-   **Set a timer.** The _other_ monster in your head might say “I don’t have time for this!” To vanquish this monster, try the [pomodoro method](https://faculty.vt.edu/faculty-development/mentoring-and-support/faculty-writing/articles-for-faculty-writers/a-fresh-take-on-the-pomodoro-technique.html#:~:text=It%20works%20like%20this%3A%20choose,take%20a%2030%2Dminute%20break.). Set a timer for 25 minutes. Don’t let yourself Ctrl-T away from that doc until time is up.
-   **It’s just work.** It’s sometimes helpful to view writing less as “creativity” and more as simply work. It happens one word and one sentence at a time. Henry Miller has a rule (quoted by Johnson): “When you can’t create, you can work.”
