## Pros

- "[Object Property] reification technique is extremely useful and we have incorporated it into our practice; nearly every relationship is reified.

There’s nothing particularly deep about reification. It’s using the standard expressivity of OWL in a repeatable pattern to convey the meaning we want. But it is, again, tedious and error-prone to do manually.
  - i.e., use [[prdct.opencaesar]]
