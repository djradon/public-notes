## Features

- Knowledge graphs can be hosted via Solid PODs, SPARQL endpoints, shTriple Pattern Fragments interfaces, RDF files, and so on
- Using content negotiation, Walder makes the data in these knowledge graphs available to clients via HTML, RDF, and JSON-LD. 
- Walder uses [[prdct.consolidate]] to automatically retrieve the corresponding engine for a given template. This means that the [supported template engines](https://www.npmjs.com/package/consolidate#supported-template-engines) are dependent on consolidate.
