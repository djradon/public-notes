- docs is special, beware
- don't edit _combined unless you're prepared to get overwritten


## Features


## Planned Features

- no-copy flag, then you can selectively bring stuff in with Lume's copy?
- filesystem
- options per source
- exit serve with error if non-multisource-generated  change detected in _combined
- try git's ssh for ops, fall back to https 

## Thoughts

### t.2024.11.20.14

- makes sense as standalone app, see [[proj.lume-multisource.conv.2024-11-20-getting-things-workable#new-application-chatgpt]]
