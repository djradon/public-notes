## [[p.hasRecipe]]

- formulate your Project List and then replicate that list across every single tool you use, now and in the future. ^IoqWYbtXfBja
  - consistent spelling, punctuation, and capitalization, so that your transitions between programs are as seamless as possible.
-  put personally relevant information in Areas, and generally useful information in Resources

## [[p.hasHighlight]]

- "what you’re committed to is not a collection of vague responsibilities, but a short list of tangible outcomes. In other words, projects."
- a project without a corresponding goal is known as a “hobby.”
- a goal without a corresponding project, that’s called a “dream.”
  - or a backlog item
- any PKM approach that doesn’t tie into execution tools is destined to languish on the back burner forever.
- perform organizational work opportunistically
- project list should change every week
