## Abstract

A simulation model is intended to capture a real-world system. Consequently, the modeling language used for making the simulation model should have a “real-world semantics” guaranteeing some kind of ontological faithfulness for the models made with it. In this paper, we propose to use ABDESO, a foundational ontology for agent-based discrete event simulation, for evaluating agent-based simulation languages.
