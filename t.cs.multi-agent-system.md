se two relations, maker and produces, are called inverse relations. Storing the information “in both directions” is redundant. When we know that a wine is produced by a winery, an application using the knowledge base can always infer the value for the inverse relation that the winery produces the wine. However, from the knowledge-acquisition perspective it is convenient t o have both pieces of information explicitly available. This approach allows users to fill in the wine in one case and the winery in another. The knowledge-acquisition system could then automatically fill in the value for the inverse relation insuring consistency of the knowledge base.
