## Testimony

- "I ran a game like this for a year or so. It's fun, but it removes a lot of the credibility that a system adds. A system lets players form expectations based on their understanding of the mechanics, which opens up emotions like dread and hope. I also find that players believing that the world runs on rules that aren't entirely in the DM's control leads to more investment in characters and outcomes."
