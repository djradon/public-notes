A subject you write or speak about.

## Thoughts

- "subject" is already overloaded in the RDF world
  - of course "object" is overloaded too, with the sense of an objective is a goal

## Quotes

- > [A topic defines a particular aspect that will be covered in conversation or in any written form, whereas subject is used in context to a wider aspect of knowledge. A subject cannot be a part of a topic whereas a subject may have many topics covered in it. However, topic and subject may be used interchangeably if they are used to denote the important aspect of a document, lecture, discussion, presentation or a conversation.][1] 
  - this sort of captures a hierarchical relationship that feels substantial, but due to overloading and wikipedia's preference for "topic" even for very general categories, probably will "smooth over" the substance
