## how does opencaesar/oml support closed-world reasoning?

OML (Ontological Modeling Language), supported by the openCAESAR framework, provides mechanisms for both open-world and closed-world reasoning. Specifically, OML allows you to define "closed-world model kinds" within its framework, which are crucial for enabling closed-world reasoning. This is particularly useful when you need to make inferences based on the assumption that all relevant information is explicitly stated in the model, which contrasts with the open-world assumption where unknown facts are treated as possibly true.

In OML, the flexibility to specify closed-world semantics is achieved through careful scoping and the use of model kinds, which can be aggregated into viewpoints that encapsulate specific concerns of stakeholders. This approach allows for rigorous reasoning and validation processes, ensuring that your models behave as expected under closed-world assumptions. Additionally, OML supports integrating these closed-world definitions into broader workflows that include automated analysis and consistency checking, making it a robust choice for complex systems engineering projects.

This capability is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to enforce strict constraints and ensure that certain conditions hold without ambiguity, which is often required in safety-critical systems and other domains where comprehensive validation is essential.
