[[c.software.game-engine]]

## Cons

- "Voxels or procedural mesh are the only things that sort of work at runtime." 
  - https://forums.unrealengine.com/t/dynamic-terrain-generation/253516/2
- no good scripting?
  - [ ] what are the limitations of [[prdct.unreal.blueprints]]
  - "Unreal has blueprint problem. If you're a sufficiently skilled coder, you cannot utilize your strength properly in unreal, because you're forced to deal with the damnable blueprints at every turn. That thing along with inheritance-based design instead of component based design is a good enough reason NOT to use unreal engine regardless of all the other features it has."

    - but 
      - "I do not recall any unreal game where you could model things from scratch while in the game. It has been done with unity, though. [[game.planet-explorers]]. Despite all its flaws. We also have [[game.anyland]], which is also unity."
      - "    unreal engine is that it does not empower small teams or individual developers. Unity does give you infinite cosmic power during prototyping phase even if you're one man army. It is efficient to the point where some people use unity to prototype and unreal for the final run. With Unreal, this is not the case. You can make something pretty. But you can't make something unusual easily. The engine will fight back."
    - and last word:
      - "[[game.astroneer]] If you want some game with terrain modification. It was made in ue4, by a tiny team, released in early access, and finished within some budget. The game is fun, looks good, and has some innovative gameplay."
     

## Issues

- could we create a generic Unreal client that connects to arbitrary game servers?
