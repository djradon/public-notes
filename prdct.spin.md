## Comparisons

## SPIN vs SHACL

- SHACL offers much greater flexibility w.r.t. the application target of constraints (and rules). While SPIN is limited to classes, SHACL shapes can be applied to either classes or sets of nodes derived by other means. See the various [target mechanisms](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/#targets) in SHACL, including the [custom targets](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl-af/#targets) from the Advanced Features document.
