## Highlights

And yes, web developers still donâ€™t speak RDF but now the number of [JavaScript libraries for RDF](http://rdf.js.org/) is significant and new languages like [LDflex](https://drive.verborgh.org/publications/iswc2020-ldflex.pdf) came to make it easier for them to work with RDF. And since web developers are more comfortable with GraphQL than SPARQL, they can now query RDF also with GraphQL.

[SPARQL is easier than most people think](https://www.strategicstructures.com/?p=1889), and yet it still represents a barrier for them to explore and exploit the growing linked knowledge on the web. But this is changing as well. Now there are ways to query SPARQL endpoints with questions asked in natural language ([QAnswer](https://the-qa-company.com/products/QAnswer), [FREyA)](https://sites.google.com/site/naturallanguageinterfaces/freya).
