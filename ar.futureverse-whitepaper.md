## Highlights


### Enter the Open Metaverse

- The Open Metaverse is the next evolution
of the internet and the digital economy;
decentralized, trustless, community-owned
and secure

### Principles

1. An immersive experience: The internet as
it is, operates within many interconnected
but separate siloes. The Metaverse
removes the boundaries between the
major categories we currently engage
with e.g finance, gaming, social media,
commerce. This creates a single
experience that encompasses all the
current features of the internet.

2. Ownership: The Metaverse is defined
by users having control over their assets,
data and transactions. Using open
source code with open standards gives
ownership back to users and control back
to communities. Itâ€™s a tug away from
the mega-corporations that currently
control almost all of the digital tangible
value in our lives. In The Metaverse,
users own their content, identity, data,
avatar and intelligence that sits behind
processes. They can move freely between
applications at will
