## Implementations

-   [Apache Jena Fuseki](https://jena.apache.org/documentation/fuseki2/): Apache Jena is an open source framework for the Semantic Web and Linked Data Part of Jena is the Fuseki triple store, which can [support GeoSPARQL](https://jena.apache.org/documentation/geosparql/geosparql-fuseki).
    
- [[prdct.rdf4j]]  [Eclipse RDF4J](https://rdf4j.org/about/) is a Java framework for working with RDF data. It can use its own data stores or data stores from other parties. [GeoSPARQL is supported](https://rdf4j.org/documentation/programming/geosparql/).
  - see https://rdf4j.org/documentation/programming/geosparql/
    
-   [Ontop-spatial](http://ontop-spatial.di.uoa.gr/): [Ontop](https://ontop-vkg.org/guide/) is a system that can be used to expose the content of arbitrary relational databases as knowledge graphs. Ontop-spatial is an extension of Ontop that offers support for GeoSPARQL.
    
-   [Ontotext GraphDB](https://www.ontotext.com/products/graphdb/) is a semantic graph database. It offers a [GeoSPARQL plugin](http://graphdb.ontotext.com/documentation/standard/geosparql-support.html).
    
-   [Openlink Virtuoso](https://virtuoso.openlinksw.com/): Virtuoso Universal Server is a data storage system that supports mutliple interfaces. It offers partial support of GeoSPARQL.
    
-   [Oracle Spatial and Graph](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/spatialandgraph.html) is a component in Oracle databases that offers support for both graph data and spatial data. It supports the GeoSPARQL standard.
    
-   [Parliament](https://github.com/SemWebCentral/parliament) is a triplestore and reasoner with support for GeoSPARQL.
    
-   [Strabon](http://www.strabon.di.uoa.gr/) is a RDF store that specializes in spatiotemporal data. It has partial support for GeoSPARQL.
    
-   [Stardog](https://www.stardog.com/) is a platform for knowledge graphs and it [supports GeoSPARQL](https://www.stardog.com/docs/#_geospatial_query).
