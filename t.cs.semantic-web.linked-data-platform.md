## Features

- Trellis does not do everything. There will naturally be a desire to make use of external systems, such as a search engine or a triple store. Trellis makes it easy to support real-time integrations of such external components by publishing a notification every time a resource is added, modified or deleted. These notifications conform to the Activity Streams 2.0 specification.
