A cluttered cupboard of jumbled jottings in the form of a [[soln.dendron]] vault.

## Purpose

This vault of notes will be a combination of

- personal knowledge graph for topics of interest
- references: bibliographic/resource information 
- publishable "resource notes", including
  -  "raw highlights" from books and articles
  - summary notes from courses and videos
- biographic references for public figures

In terms of the [[t.km.zettelkasten]] method, it's a commingling of literature notes with something Ahrens warned about: a "personal Wikipedia or a database" [1](book.how-to-take-smart-notes.md). 

In terms of [[t.tm.getting-things-done]], it's references, someday-maybe, next actions, and public projects

[[ar.swyx.learn-in-public]]


## [[p.vs]]

- evergreen-notes/digital-garden: for "synthesized" / original-ish publishable big-idea notes that should evolve over time, props to @Andy-Matuschak
- blog: for "point-in-time" items to be shared: personal news, articles 
- predicates: a public enumeration of useful properties
- private-notes: 
  - "fleeting notes", journal entries
  - INBOX
  - personal 
    - task management
    - project management
    - project/product ideas
    - inventory management
  - non-public people notes
  - experimentation
- archive: for old task, projects, and other junk
  - maybe not necessary?
