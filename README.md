A cluttered cupboard of jumbled jottings in the form of a [[solution.dendron]] vault.

## Purpose

This vault of notes will be a combination of

- personal knowledge graph for topics of interest
- references: bibliographic/resource information 
- publishable "resource notes", including
  -  "raw highlights" from books and articles
  - summary notes from courses and videos
- biographic references

In terms of the [[t.km.zettelkasten]] method, it's a commingling of literature notes with something Ahrens warned about: a "personal Wikipedia or a database" [1](book.how-to-take-smart-notes.md). 

In terms of [[t.tm.getting-things-done]], it's inbox and references

[[article.learn-in-public]]

- private-notes: 
  - "fleeting notes", journal entries
