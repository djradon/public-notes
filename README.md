A cluttered cupboard of jumbled jottings in the form of a [[solution.dendron]] vault.

## Purpose

This vault of notes will be a combination of

- personal knowledge graph for topics of interest
- references: bibliographic/resource information 
- publishable "literature notes"
  - including "raw highlights"



## [[pred.vs]]

- evergreen-notes/digital-garden: for "synthesized" / original-ish publishable big-idea notes that should evolve over time, props to @Andy-Matuschak
- blog: for "point-in-time" "items to be shared: news, articles, 
- predicates: a public enumeration of useful properties
- private-notes: "fleeting notes", journal entries, INBOX, non-publishable task management, non-public people notes
- archive: for old task, projects, and other junk
  - maybe not necessary?
