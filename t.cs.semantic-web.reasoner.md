## Implementations

### Open-Source

-   [Cwm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cwm_(software) "Cwm (software)"), a forward-chaining reasoner used for querying, checking, transforming and filtering information. Its core language is RDF, extended to include rules, and it uses RDF/XML or N3 serializations as required.
-   [Drools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drools "Drools"), a forward-chaining inference-based rules engine which uses an enhanced implementation of the [Rete algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rete_algorithm "Rete algorithm").
-   [Evrete](https://www.evrete.org), a forward-chaining Java rule engine that uses the [Rete algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rete_algorithm "Rete algorithm") and is compliant with the Java Rule Engine API (JSR 94).
-   [D3web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D3web "D3web"), a platform for [knowledge-based systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge-based_systems "Knowledge-based systems") ([expert systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_systems "Expert systems")).
-   [Flora-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flora-2 "Flora-2"), an object-oriented, rule-based knowledge-representation and reasoning system.
-  [[prdct.jena]] [Jena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jena_(framework) "Jena (framework)"), an open-source semantic-web framework for Java which includes a number of different semantic-reasoning modules.
-   [NRules](https://github.com/NRules/NRules) a forward-chaining inference-based rules engine implemented in [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language) "C Sharp (programming language)") which uses an enhanced implementation of the [Rete algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rete_algorithm "Rete algorithm")
-   [Prova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prova "Prova"), a semantic-web rule engine which supports data integration via SPARQL queries and type systems (RDFS, OWL ontologies as type system).
-   [DIP](https://github.com/kodymoodley/defeasibleinferenceplatform), Defeasible-Inference Platform (DIP) is an [Web Ontology Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Ontology_Language "Web Ontology Language") reasoner and [Protégé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prot%C3%A9g%C3%A9_(software) "Protégé (software)") desktop plugin for representing and reasoning with defeasible subsumption.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_reasoner#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> It implements a [Preferential entailment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferential_entailment "Preferential entailment") style of reasoning that reduces to "classical entailment" i.e., without the need to modify the underlying decision procedure.
