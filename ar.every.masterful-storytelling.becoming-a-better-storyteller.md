  - Find your minimal viable story
    - Person + setting + an outcome that matters (also known as stakes). 
      - Who is the protagonist (maybe it’s you, maybe it’s someone else) 
      - Where and when are they? 
      - What do they want? 
      - Why does the outcome matter? 
  - Dial in the details
    - “The number one problem with stories is too little detail,” Adam says. “The number two problem is too much detail.”
    - choose details strategically, ie. to help the reader
  - Set up your stakes with the Five Whys
    - ultimately should appeal to a peasant in india 1000 yrs ago
  - build up your storytelling sensor (in your heart and in your brain)
    - The very act of feeling like you're a crappy storyteller is a very promising thing
