## Abstract

In this short position paper, we argue that there is a need for a unify- ing data model that can support popular graph formats such as RDF, RDF* and property graphs, while at the same time being powerful enough to naturally store information from complex knowledge graphs, such as Wikidata, without the need for a complex reification scheme. Our proposal, called the multilayer graph model, presents a simple and flexible data model for graphs that can naturally support all of the above, and more. We also observe that the idea of multi- layer graphs has appeared in existing graph systems from different vendors and research groups, illustrating its versatility.
