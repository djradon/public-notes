## could you call the preference for reified, relator-based relationship specification in RDF "relator-based predication"?

@chatgpt.4o:

Yes, the term "relator-based predication" could be a suitable way to describe a preference for reified, relator-based relationship specification in RDF. In the context of RDF and ontologies, "predication" refers to the act of stating or asserting a property or relationship about a subject. By incorporating "relator-based," the term specifically emphasizes the use of relators (or relationships modeled as intermediary entities) to express these assertions.

This approach aligns with ontological theories, such as those found in the OntoClean methodology or the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), where relations (relators) are often treated as first-class entities that connect other entities. "Relator-based predication" would emphasize the use of these intermediary entities (relators) for more complex and explicit relationship modeling in RDF, as opposed to using simple direct predicates.

So, "relator-based predication" effectively conveys the method and philosophy behind using relators for relationship specification in RDF.
