  - "true fun... materializes when we experience the confluence of three psychological states: [[playfulness|t.psych.playfulness]], [[connection|t.psych.connectedness]] and [[flow|t.psych.flow]]."
  - “Fake” fun is my term for activities that take up our leisure time, but they don’t inspire playfulness or connection, or result in the total engagement that happens with flow. 
  - Try to create as much connection, playfulness and flow in your everyday life as possible, whether it’s by sharing a smile with a stranger, calling a colleague instead of emailing or doing something nice for a friend. Every time you do so, take note of how it affects your mood.
