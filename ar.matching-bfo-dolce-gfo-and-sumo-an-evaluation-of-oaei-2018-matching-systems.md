## Conclusion

- This paper presented an analysis of the alignments between four top-level ontologies, BFO, DOLCE, GFO and SUMO. Our goal was to analyse the behaviour of current state of the art tools, which apply diverse matching techniques, with respect to this task. We could observe that matching top-level ontologies automatically is a challenging task, in particular when involving subsumption relations
- matching systems need to be improved to better exploit the knowledge e
