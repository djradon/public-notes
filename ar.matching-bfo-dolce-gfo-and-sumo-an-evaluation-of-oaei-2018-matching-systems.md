## Conclusion

- This paper presented an analysis of the alignments between four top-level ontologies, BFO, DOLCE, GFO and SUMO. Our goal was to analyse the behaviour of current state of the art tools, which apply diverse matching techniques, with respect to this task. We could observe that matching top-level ontologies automatically is a challenging task, in particular when involving subsumption relations
- matching systems need to be improved to better exploit the knowledge en- coded in the ontologies, to include more abstract and philosophical semantic relations and semiotic matching, to take advantage of structural features of the ontologies and axioms in order to better compare their formal definitions, and to take advantage of background knowledge from external resources targeting subsumption and other semantic relations. These have to be combined with logical reasoning techniques for guarantee the consis- tency of the generated alignments. The current approaches have to be hence revised to better deal with the specificities of matching foundational ontologies.
