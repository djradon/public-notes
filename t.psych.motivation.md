  - "Motivation comes and goes. If you want to do something consistently, then don't pick a level of difficulty that requires great motivation. Make it easy enough and simple enough that you'll do it even when you don't feel very motivated."
- @cindy-daignault
  - "I just want things to be meaningful, and that often involves working hard. Iâ€™m sure every person you interview can talk about this. Caring about what you do usually means working a lot of hours."
