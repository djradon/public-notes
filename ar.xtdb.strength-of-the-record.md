## Highlights

- When we pick apart a label like "system bus", and thus the [etymology of "omnibus"](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/omnibus), we begin to see the exercise of _naming things_ in two parts. The first, and more obvious, is the coining of terms. The more important second part is the construction of metaphors.
