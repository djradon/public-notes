## Highlights

- Object mapping is a broken metaphor.
- When we pick apart a label like "system bus", and thus the [etymology of "omnibus"](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/omnibus), we begin to see the exercise of _naming things_ in two parts. The first, and more obvious, is the coining of terms. The more important second part is the construction of metaphors.
- Object DBs simply never took off. An object isn’t a simple or intuitive concept; an object is type-matching dynamic dispatch implemented over a collection of closures which in turn share a second collection of lexically-bound variables which themselves are — you guessed it — more objects.

### Triples

- Roughly, there are two categories of triples: RDF triples, which attempt to encode relationship semantics, and EAV triples,
- purity can be a dangerous waste of time
- triples by their very nature only describe relationships. Despite their name, relational databases consign the very notion of a "relationship" to the realm of the derivative. Triples have the opposite problem. Triples treat nouns as second-class citizens.
  - If triples are to say anything about the form of the data they contain, we must slather them in complicated ontologies.
