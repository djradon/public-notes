- "Ray and Dave Davies regularly fought each other on-stage in The '60s. Therefore the American Musicians' Union banned the Kinks from touring in the U.S. from 1965â€“69. This led to Ray and Dave being isolated from and uninvolved with American politics and counterculture. They reverted to writing about British concerns, British culture and Britain, from a British perspective, language and humour separated from their Americanized peers. This may have hurt their sales in America, but it did give them an identity as Britpop innovators."
