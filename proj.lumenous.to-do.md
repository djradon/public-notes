- verify netlify.tom works
- make into proper theme
- bug in doc-navbar.vto: when docs sections were renamed to I, II, II, pages started cross-appearing
- no section level index page in doc-navbar
- restore static/init.ts 
- fix checkUrls when building with a location ( or maybe do local serving from subdirectory)
