## Cons

- "Notebooks shouldn't be used, however, as a component of a production system. The notebook structure - with its casual mix of IO, calculation, and UI - is there to encourage interactivity, but works against the modularity needed for code that is used as part of a broader code base. It's best to think of notebooks as a way of exploring logic, once you've found a path, that logic should be replicated into a library designed for production use."
