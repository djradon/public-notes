## [[c.Con]]

- doesn't support streams natively
  - "While certain situations require the rich state querying capabilities of the Java-based Kafka Streams, other scenarios, such as edge deployments or serverless functions, may prefer a more lightweight approach. Node.js, for example, generally offers faster startup times and a smaller footprint."
