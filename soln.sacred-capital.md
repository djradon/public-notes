- [[p.hasVision]] 
  - a Wix-like environment where non-techie community activators can bundle together the tools they need to shift their communities from, say, an awkward mish-mash of GSuite, Facebook, and Discord to the crypto web.
- [[p.hasConcept]]
  - We prefer to think in terms of “neighbourhoods” because, unlike platforms, neighbourhoods are not burdened by: ^1uVLS5bphpiF
    - vendor lock-in
    - algorithms whose obscure operations dictate what we stumble upon
    - corporate-driven community guidelines
    - centralized storage of sensitive, interpersonal data and communication
      - (although to make a game fair, you can submit your information to a trustworty MCP)
