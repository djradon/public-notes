- "Building an ontology from small modules that can be specialized for different domains brings
understandability and homogeneity to the overall ontology. Modular ontologies based on
such module specializations enable developers of specific applications to create custom views
by selecting the set of required specializations. The underlying knowledge factorization also
streamlines the development process and eases maintainability and resilience, considering that
problems arising within a module are handled in a targeted fashion."
