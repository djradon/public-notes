## Issues

- no OWL or any other machine-readable represenation
  - but [[prdct.unified-foundational-ontology.gUFO]]
- [[ar.github.nemo-ufes.gufo.are-all-relations-instances-of-either-material-relationship-type-or-comparative-relationship-type]]

## Features

### Relations

- "We divide relations into two broad categories, called Material and Formal relations."
  - Formal relations hold between two or more entities directly without any further intervening individual. Examples of formal relations are:
    - 5 is greater than 3
    - this day is part of this month
    - N is subset of Q
  - but also the relations of instantiation, inherence, quale of a quality, association, existential dependence, among others – … relations that form the mathematical superstructure of our framework. _Material relations,_ conversely, have material structure on their own and include examples such as:
    -   employments
    -   kisses
    -   enrollments
    -   flight connections
    -   commitments
   


## Composition

-   **UFO-A**: An Ontology of Endurants dealing with aspects of structural conceptual modeling. It is organized as a [[t.km.ontology.four-category]] ontology comprising theories of Types and Taxonomic Structures connected to a theory of object identifiers (including a formal semantics in a Sortal Quantified Modal Logics), Part-Whole Relations, Particularized Intrinsic Properties, Attributes and Attribute Value Spaces (including a theory of Datatypes as Measure Structures), Particularized Relational Properties and Relations and Roles;
  

-   **UFO-B**: An Ontology of Perdurants (Events, Processes) dealing with aspects such as Perdurant Mereology, Temporal Ordering of Perdurants, Object Participation in Perdurants, Causation, Change and the connection between Perdurants and Endurants via Dispositions;
   

-   **[[UFO-C|prdct.unified-foundational-ontology.ufo-c]]:** An Ontology of Simple Intentional and Social Entities, which is constructed on top of UFO- A and UFO-B, and which addresses notions such as Beliefs, Desires, Intentions, Goals, Actions, Commitments and Claims, Social Roles and Social Particularized Relational Complexes (Social Relators), among others.
