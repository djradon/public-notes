## Thoughts

- "Notice that in conceptual modelling, and in simulation modelling, we are not really interested to con-
sider all the things that constitute a real-world system. We call those things, in which we are interested,
entities, including: physical objects, events and certain material relationships. This choice implies that we
do not want to include amounts of matter, relators or qualities in a simulation model."
  - relators: a kiss, a covalent bond, a medical treatment, a purchase order, or a social commitment.
  - why wouldn't you want to include relators and qualities in a simulation model?
