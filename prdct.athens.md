- [[p.hasRepository]] https://github.com/athensresearch/athens
- [[p.hasDemonstration]] https://athensresearch.github.io/athens/#/
- [[p.hasBlog]] https://athensresearch.ghost.io/
- [[p.hasApplication]] [[t.km.pkm]] [[t.km.ckm]]
- [[p.similarTo]] [[prdct.notion]]

- [[p.hasConcept]]
  - `[[type]]` is the most global level attribute. It applies to both knowledge pages (e.g. notes, writings, and documentation) as well as action pages (e.g. objectives, projects)

## [[p.hasRoadmapItems]]

- comments and suggestions like in Google Docs, but addressable and referenceable
- forking, branching, and merging
- cross-graph references 
  - [[p.begsQuestion]] "[Should cross-graph references update in real-time or require confirmation? History, identity, and permissioning are fundamental challenges when it comes to building shared graphs.](https://athensresearch.ghost.io/season-2/)" 

## [[p.hasFeature]]
  - If you mention two pages in tandem, either in the same bullet or sub-bullet (just as I did above), Athens will automatically link the pages. So, using the example I created, if you clicked on the restaurant [[Muzita Abyssinian Bistro]], not only can you type new content on that page, but you can immediately see it’s linked to “March 26, 2021,” “Kaito,” “San Diego,” and “Siga Kilwa.” Athens generated those associations that you determined were important.

## [[p.hasCon]]
- standalone app-ish (but )
- storage isn't git-enabled or plaintext?
