## Ideas

- keep a cache (per-user, per dataset, per domain) of the most-used and trending properties and identifiers.

## hey chatgpt, could you build a form-based (GUI) vscode extension for authoring RDF data?

Yes, it's definitely possible to build a form-based (GUI) VSCode extension for authoring RDF data. Here's how you could approach it:

### Key Features for the Extension:
1. **Form-Based Editing**:
   - Create a user interface that lets users fill in forms to add or edit RDF triples.
   - The form could include fields for the subject, predicate, object, and context (if named graphs are used).
   - Users could select predefined vocabularies and predicates, potentially providing autocomplete suggestions.

2. **Graph Visualization**:
   - Integrate a simple graph visualization tool to provide a graphical view of RDF data.
   - This can be implemented using libraries like **VivaGraphJS** or **D3.js** to offer a dynamic visualization of RDF data directly within VSCode.

3. **Data Validation**:
   - Add features to validate RDF data against a given schema, such as SHACL or OWL.
   - Provide visual feedback when data does not conform to the schema, helping ensure RDF consistency.

4. **Connection to Triplestores**:
   - Enable users to connect to external RDF stores like Jena Fuseki, Stardog, or others.
   - Allow users to load, query, and update RDF data directly from these sources, giving them more flexibility.

5. **Integration with Git**:
   - Given that many users might want to store RDF data in Git repositories, include direct Git integration for version control.
   - Allow users to fork, commit, and merge RDF datasets directly from the extension.

### Tools and Technologies to Use:
- **VSCode API**: Use the Visual Studio Code API to create panels, form inputs, and commands. VSCode allows custom webviews, which are perfect for building form-based UIs within the IDE.
- **React/HTML for GUI**: Use **React** or vanilla **HTML/CSS** to build the form-based UI components. VSCode's webview panels can display these forms and handle user input effectively.
- **RDF Libraries**:
  - **rdflib.js**: JavaScript library for parsing and serializing RDF data. This could help in handling the RDF data behind the scenes.
  - **Turtle.js** or similar libraries can help manage serialization for various RDF formats (e.g., Turtle, JSON-LD).
- **Data Visualization**:
  - **D3.js** or **VivaGraphJS** to provide a visual representation of RDF triples, making it easier to understand the relationships between entities.
- **Node.js Backend**: If needed, Node.js could be used to interact with external RDF stores or for other backend services.

### Challenges:
- **Complexity of RDF Data**: RDF can become complex quickly, especially with nested structures or ontologies. The UI would need to strike a balance between being intuitive and supporting advanced RDF capabilities.
- **Extending Predicates and Vocabularies**: Handling various vocabularies and ensuring they’re up to date would require periodic updates or some way of fetching vocabularies dynamically.

### Example Workflow:
1. **User selects "Create RDF Triple" from a VSCode command palette.**
2. **A form panel opens**, with input fields for "Subject," "Predicate," "Object," and a dropdown for selecting a named graph (if applicable).
3. **Validation messages** appear in real-time if the RDF input doesn’t conform to the selected schema.
4. **Graph view** is available as a tab to visualize how new triples relate to existing ones.
5. **Save and commit** directly to Git, with options to merge changes into a collaborative RDF dataset.

### Benefits:
- **Local-First Approach**: This extension could easily support a local-first workflow, letting users work on RDF files offline and integrate with Git for versioning.
- **User-Friendly**: The form-based GUI could lower the barrier for users unfamiliar with RDF syntax, making semantic data authoring more accessible to non-programmers.

This kind of VSCode extension could be a very useful tool for semantic data management, especially for those who want the benefits of a GUI without leaving the VSCode environment. Let me know if you’re interested in any specific part of the development process, and I can provide more details!
