## Theories

- phenomena that have happened
- phenomena that are scheduled to happen

### Moens & Steedman

- Events have beginning and end points
  - (what about ongoing events?)
- Events are punctual or extended in time
- Event types:
  - Culmination: instantaneous, introduces a transition from one state to another
    - Example: Harry reached the top. Harry has reached the top.
  - Point: an indivisible whole
    - Example: John hiccupped.
  - Process: has no culmination
    - Example: Harry climbed.
      - but couldn't there be an implication that he climbed to somewhere
  - CulminatedProcess: a process that has a culmination

  - States: indefinitely extending states of affairs
