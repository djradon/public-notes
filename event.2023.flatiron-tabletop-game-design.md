- Where is the overlap between product design and tabletop game design
  - user psychology: 
    - what hooks people
    - what's too boring/complex
  - visual design principles
  - "exploration and validation": 
    - design thinking [[double diamond|t.pdm.design.double-diamond]]
  - system mechanics
    - comes down to a knowledge of design patterns
  - user experience
    - information architecture (IA)
      - What is the path from A to B
      - User decision space
      - outcomes and goals
    - users come in with preconceived mental models... cognitive load is less when your game fits into their schemas
- defining the project

  - design principles, e.g.:
    - depth > complexity
    - simplicity > fidelity
    - avoid rigid narratives
    - best strategist should would
  - constraints
    - mechanics
      - e.g.
        - dice rolling
        - end game bonuses
        - grid coverage
        - hex grid
        - pattern building
        - set collection
        - tile placement
        - turn order: stat-based
        - variable set-up
        - worker placement
      - complexity and player cognitive capacity
      - what mechanics are removed/added/changed for different player counts
      - solo play
    - categories
      - ![](/assets/images/2023-01-11-10-23-47.png)
- [[t.management.swot-analysis]]
- [[t.pdm.ux.prototyping]] gives you high-level buy-in
- [[p.mentioned]] [[prdct.tabletopia.workshop]]
- players get frustrated waiting for other players
  - like axis&allies
  - turn-based is inherently frustrating, so give people something else to do when it's not their turn
- analysis
  - satisfaction
  - time to goal
  - avg # turns/moves/card to goal
  - qualitative
    - Did you feel like you agaency
- "build your design process around playtesting. everything else is theorycraft"
- [[t.pdm.design.visual]]
  - color can 
    - create categories
    - indicate interactivity
    - create separation

- What is interesting?
  - fun vs challenging
  - sweet spot of interestingness
    - ![](/assets/images/2023-01-11-10-55-12.png)
      - obvious vs absurd
      - relevant vs irrelevant
    - enhances memory
    - enhances motivation
    - emotive response
  - triggers of fascination
    - pleaure
    - mystique: puzzling, being part of a secret
    - alarm
    - prestige
    - power
    - vice
    - trust
  - theory of fun:
    - when we find and master new patterns of thought
    - to master a game, we have to figure out certain patterns
    - once we've done it, the game is not as much fun
    - if we can find any patterns, the game is too difficult and not  fun.
    - games tend to be most fun when pushing us to the edge of our capabilities while simultaneously giving us a sense that master is a real possibility
    - ![](/assets/images/2023-01-11-10-59-25.png)
      - if we are fascinated, we will have fun looking for patterns
      - disruption is often resisted because it takes energy
