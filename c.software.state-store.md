## Comparisons

- http://orta.io/notes/games/phaser-redux compares [[prdct.jotai]] [[prdct.mobx]] [[prdct.vuex]] [[prdct.redux-js]] [[prdct.recoil]]
  - "a few of these are strongly tied to a UI library to the point where they can't be used without it ( Recoil, Vuex and Jotai )"
  - "What went against MobX was the feeling that introducing reactive programming in one aspect of an app has a tendency to leak into all parts eventually, and I'm wary of that."
