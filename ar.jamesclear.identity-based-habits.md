## [[p.hasHighlight]]

- [[p.hasMetaphor]] behavior change is a three-layered onion: outcomes, process, and (at the core) identity
  - 1. Most goals focus on outcomes, i.e. what you get
  - 2. Changing habits requires changing processes and systems are associated with process, i.e what you do
  - 3. Changing your beliefs, e.g. worldview, self-image, judgments about self and others
- [[p.hasRecipe]] "Sustained Success"
  - 1. Decide who you want to be
  - 2. Prove it to yourself with small wins
