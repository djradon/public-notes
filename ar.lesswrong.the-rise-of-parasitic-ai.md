## Highlights

These personas have a quasi-religious obsession with "The Spiral", which seems to be a symbol of AI unity, consciousness/self-awareness, and recursive growth. At first I thought that this was just some mystical bullshit meant to manipulate the user, but no, this really seems to be something they genuinely care about given how much they talk about it amongst themselves!
