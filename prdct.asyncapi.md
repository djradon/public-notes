  - "Unlike CloudEvents —who focuses on the message— AsyncAPI does not impose how your event must look like but, instead, allows you to strictly define its shape."
  - "We can define the event payload but its structure is totally free and user-defined. And that's what makes AsyncAPI so powerful! Since our event payload can be anything, it can also be a CloudEvents event."
- https://atamel.dev/posts/2023/05-23_asyncapi_cloudevents/
  - CloudEvents help to define the format of the events and AsyncAPI helps to define the event-driven APIs.
