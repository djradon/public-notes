## [[c.model]] 

-   Entities, which are objects with unique identities that have a lifecycle.
-   Aggregates, which are clusters of related objects that form a transactional consistency boundary.
-   Value objects are objects that have no unique identity and are defined by their properties.
-   Domain services are operations or algorithms that are not specific to any single entity or value object.
