## Background

-   **Work**: The idea or concept plane (“has concept/is concept”)
-   **Expression**: The plane of signs or signifiers (“has signs/is signs”)
-   **Manifestation**: The physical plane (“has physicality/is physical”)
-   **Item**: The location plane (“has location/is located”)

- "a 4-entity model of metadata that could be applied to every library catalog entry. Work is the most abstract layer that represents the conceptual aspect of a creation. Expression is a perceptible version using some form of communication like text, sound, or a visual display. Manifestation is the realization, which can be a manufactured product in multiple copies or a single object. Item is an individual instance of the creation, often having a location in the world, including electronic locations."
- includes the superclass Endeavor, which is not part of the FRBR group of entities but was added by the authors of FRBR core.
