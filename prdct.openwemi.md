## Background

- "a 4-entity model of metadata that could be applied to every library catalog entry. Work is the most abstract layer that represents the conceptual aspect of a creation. Expression is a perceptible version using some form of communication like text, sound, or a visual display. Manifestation is the realization, which can be a manufactured product in multiple copies or a single object. Item is an individual instance of the creation, often having a location in the world, including electronic locations."
