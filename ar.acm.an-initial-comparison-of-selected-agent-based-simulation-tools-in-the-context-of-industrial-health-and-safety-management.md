## [[c.Highlight]]

- The fact that GAMA's [[prdct.gama.gaml]] uses the concept of an agent in a broader way makes it a little more complex than NetLogo but also more flexible insofar as that it supports the composition of different models [11, p. 241] which the user is advised to exploit when generating more complex models [40, p. 308].
- While NetLogo and ReLogo are limited to the four classical types (patch, turtle, link and observer), GAML enables its user to create their own agent types. However, note that when using Repast Simphony-Java agents do not need belong to a parent class
- While Repast Simphony comes with Eclipse and its features, it separates the runtime interface for model visualization which makes modeling less comfortable compared to NetLogo and GAMA.
