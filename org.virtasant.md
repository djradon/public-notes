- trusted advisor leaves a lot to be desired
- they add recommendation to jira, then help engineers execute
- charge 25% of savings annualized
- can pull from cloud APIs, datadog
- process:
  - engineer accepts as "net new" reduction
  - month later, bill has to have been reduced
- can do an audit of cloud efficiency (a measure of $ spent for actual workload)
  - can give you ammunition for negotiations
  - available in looker via cross-account access
- trains engineers to think differently
- builds efficiencies into terraform
