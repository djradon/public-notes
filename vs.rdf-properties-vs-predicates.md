- one of the biggest mistake of RDF: predicates are ??
  - 2021-11-07 don't remember what I was going to say here, but likely something about how predicates supposedly express properties, when really they just express predicates (i.e., part of a property)

## thoughts

- 2021-11-07 : the predicate kinda corresponds to the "attribute" part of "attribute-value pairs"; property feels like it should correspond to a concrete attribute-value pair, not just a predicate. 
- some classes have default "getter/setter" verbs, that's kinda properties. so I can see "The predicate indicates a binary relation, also known as a property."
- "The predicate indicates a binary relation, also known as a property."
  - this is the kinda opposing what I've been thinking: the relation is the property, as opposed to the resource
