one of the biggest mistake of RDF: predicates are `

- [[related]] [[vs.property-graphs-vs-semantic-graphs]]

## thoughts

- some classes have default "getter/setter" verbs, that's kinda properties. so I can see "The predicate indicates a binary relation, also known as a property."
- comparability
- "The predicate indicates a binary relation, also known as a property."
  - this is the kinda opposing what I've been thinking: the relation is the property, as opposed to the resource
