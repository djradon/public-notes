## Thoughts

- maybe it's that "the idea of Batman" exists
  - t.2024.06.08.17 i.e., the character Batman is abstract
    - t.2024.07.23.19 except it has a time, like conception time

## Issues and Arguments

- "if we admit a certain kind of entity, we cannot but admit all the other kinds of entities that figure in the identity conditions of such an entity; we admit fictional works; so we cannot but also admit fictional objects because they figure in the identity conditions of fictional works (cf. Voltolini 2003, 2006)."
- "Lee (2022), for example, argues that the identity of fictional characters is (usually) to be settled by appeal to authorial intentions rather than principles of identity, and that this is enough to disarm alleged examples of ontic determinacy"
- "a work is fiction iff (a) it is the product of a fictive intent and (b) if the work is true, then it is at most accidentally true. (1990: 46)" but "So there are parts of many, if not most, works of fiction that are non-accidentally true, and so the works should not straightforwardly count as fiction according to the criteria set out by Currie and by Lamarque and Olsen."
