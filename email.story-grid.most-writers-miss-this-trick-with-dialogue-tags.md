Hi Dave,

Hi [FIRST NAME],

Have you ever read a passage of dialogue that felt flat and lifeless, even though the words themselves were compelling? Or maybe you've read a scene where you couldn't tell who was speaking, forcing you to backtrack and count lines of dialogue?

The culprit might be dialogue tags—those little phrases like "he said" or "she asked" that connect speech to characters.

They might seem insignificant, but dialogue tags are actually powerful tools that can make or break your reader's experience. Today, I'm going to show you how to harness their full potential.
What Are Dialogue Tags (And Why They Matter)

Dialogue tags are phrases that attribute speech to a character and often describe how something is said. They serve three essential purposes:

    Clarity — They let readers know who's speaking
    Tone — They convey how something is said
    Context — They provide additional information about the scene or characters

Think of dialogue tags as the body language of your written conversations. In real life, we don't just hear words—we see facial expressions, note voice volume, and observe physical movements. Dialogue tags help recreate this multidimensional experience on the page.

Here's a simple example:
"I can't believe you did this," she said.

Now watch what happens when we change just the tag:
"I can't believe you did this," she whispered.
"I can't believe you did this," she shouted.
"I can't believe you did this," she laughed.

Same words, completely different scenes. That's the power of dialogue tags.

But like any tool, balance is key. Too many unique tags and your writing feels melodramatic and distracting. Too few tags (or always defaulting to "said") and your dialogue can feel monotonous or confusing.

The goal is finding the sweet spot where tags enhance your dialogue without calling attention to themselves.
The 12 Categories of Dialogue Tags

If you're like many writers, your dialogue tag vocabulary might be limited to "said," "asked," and maybe a handful of others. But Story Grid principles identify 12 distinct categories of dialogue tags, each serving a specific purpose in your storytelling toolkit:

1. Basic Tags

Simple and unobtrusive, keeping focus on the dialogue itself.

    Examples:said, replied, asked, answered

2. Volume Tags

Indicate loudness or quietness, adding emotional texture.

    Examples:whispered, shouted, murmured, bellowed

3. Emotion Tags

Reflect a character's feelings or emotional state.

    Examples:laughed, sobbed, snarled, sighed

4. Tone Tags

Convey the manner of speech, from sarcasm to seriousness.

    Examples:quipped, scolded, taunted, encouraged

5. Speed and Rhythm Tags

Show pacing and thought processes.

    Examples:stammered, rushed, mumbled, droned

6. Action Tags

Combine speech with physical movement.

    Examples:gasped, panted, wheezed, choked

7. Confidence/Uncertainty Tags

Indicate a character's level of certainty or doubt.

    Examples:asserted, guessed, speculated, doubted

8. Information Tags

Used when characters share knowledge or provide explanations.

    Examples:explained, elaborated, revealed, described

9. Questioning Tags

Highlight curiosity or interrogation.

    Examples:inquired, interrogated, probed, queried

10. Persuasion Tags

Showcase attempts to convince or suggest.

    Examples:urged, coaxed, implored, advised

11. Agreement/Disagreement Tags

Express accord or opposition.

    Examples:agreed, objected, protested, disputed

12. Surprise/Realization Tags

Capture astonishment or sudden understanding.

    Examples:exclaimed, gasped, marveled, deduced

Each category gives you specific tools to enhance your dialogue in different ways. The key is knowing when and how to use them—which is exactly what we'll cover next.
Bringing Dialogue to Life

Now that you understand the different types of dialogue tags, let's explore how they can transform your writing in three powerful ways.
Adding Emotional Depth

Dialogue tags are your secret weapon for conveying emotion without resorting to telling. Consider these examples:
"I don't want to talk about it," she said.
"I don't want to talk about it," she whispered.
"I don't want to talk about it," she snapped.

Each tag creates a completely different emotional landscape. The first is neutral, the second suggests vulnerability or secrecy, and the third reveals irritation or anger.

The beauty of emotional tags is that they show rather than tell. Instead of writing "she said angrily," you can use "she snapped," allowing readers to experience the emotion rather than simply being informed of it.
Creating Subtext Through Tags

One of the most sophisticated uses of dialogue tags is to create subtext—the gap between what characters say and what they actually mean. This happens when your tag contradicts or complicates the spoken words:
"Everything's fine," he muttered, avoiding her gaze.
"I'm happy for you," she said through clenched teeth.
"We should do this again sometime," he stammered.

In each example, the tag reveals the truth beneath the surface. The character claims everything is fine, but the muttering and avoidance suggest otherwise. The second character isn't genuinely happy, and the third is likely uncomfortable with the encounter.

This technique draws readers deeper into your story by making them active participants—they must interpret the subtext rather than having everything spelled out for them.
Revealing Character Through Tags

The way a character speaks reveals who they are. Dialogue tags can efficiently establish personality traits and habits without lengthy exposition:

    A character who frequently "mumbles" or "stammers" might be shy or insecure
    Someone who often "declares" or "pronounces" likely has confidence or authority
    A person who typically "drawls" or "sighs" while speaking might be bored or disinterested

By consistently using certain tags with specific characters, you create recognizable speech patterns that deepen characterization. This approach is especially useful for side characters who may not get as much page time for development.
Common Pitfalls to Avoid

Even with the best intentions, dialogue tags can sometimes weaken rather than strengthen your writing. Here are the three most common mistakes and how to avoid them:
1. Redundancy

This happens when your tag repeats information that's already clear from the dialogue or context:

Redundant: "I'm so angry!" she shouted angrily.

Better: "I'm so angry!" she shouted.

Even better: "I'm so angry!" She slammed her fist on the table.

If the dialogue already conveys the emotion, you don't need to reinforce it in the tag. In the third example, replacing the tag with an action can be even more powerful—showing the character's anger through behavior rather than telling us about it through a tag.
2. Distracting Tags

While varied tags add flavor to your writing, overly creative or unusual tags can pull readers out of the story:

Distracting: "Meet me at eight," he ejaculated. (Yes, this was once a common dialogue tag, but modern readers will find it jarring!)

Distracting: "I don't understand," she verbalized questioningly.

Better: "I don't understand," she said, frowning.

The best dialogue tags enhance the story without drawing attention to themselves. If readers are noticing your clever tags instead of absorbing the conversation, you've gone too far.
3. Overusing Tags

Not every line of dialogue needs a tag. In a conversation between two characters, readers can often follow who's speaking without constant reminders:

Overtagged: "Are you coming tonight?" she asked. "I'm not sure," he replied. "Please try," she urged. "I'll see what I can do," he said.

Better: "Are you coming tonight?" she asked. "I'm not sure." "Please try." He shrugged. "I'll see what I can do."

Notice how the improved version uses only one tag, one action beat, and relies on the back-and-forth pattern for the rest. This creates a more natural reading experience and keeps the focus on the dialogue itself.
Guidelines for Effective Use

Now that we've explored both the power of dialogue tags and their potential pitfalls, let's focus on practical guidelines to help you use them effectively in your writing.
Match the Scene's Tone

Your dialogue tags should align with the emotional and narrative tone of the scene. This creates consistency and reinforces the mood you're building:

    In a tense, suspenseful scene, tags like "whispered," "hissed," or "murmured" can heighten the sense of danger
    For a romantic encounter, consider "breathed," "sighed," or "murmured" to enhance intimacy
    During a heated argument, tags like "snapped," "shouted," or "interrupted" amplify the conflict

The key is consistency—jarring shifts in tag tone can undermine the atmosphere you've carefully crafted. Think of dialogue tags as instruments in your orchestra—they should play in harmony with the scene's overall melody.
Balance Variety and Simplicity

Finding the right balance between basic tags like "said" and more descriptive options is crucial for smooth, engaging dialogue. Here's a helpful approach:

    Use "said" as your default — It's nearly invisible to readers and keeps the focus on the dialogue itself
    Add descriptive tags for emphasis — Save more specific tags for moments when tone or emotion needs highlighting
    Intersperse action beats — Replace some tags with character actions to show emotion and create visual interest
    Skip tags entirely when clarity allows — In a back-and-forth exchange between two characters, you can often omit tags after establishing who's speaking

A good rule of thumb: If "said" would work, use it. Save specialized tags for when they add genuine value to the scene.
Questions to Ask Yourself When Choosing Tags

When you're revising dialogue, run through these quick questions to ensure your tags are strengthening rather than weakening your writing:

    Does this tag enhance the tone I'm trying to create?
    Would "said" work just as well here?
    Is the emotion already clear from the dialogue itself?
    Could an action beat replace this tag more effectively?
    Will readers know who's speaking without this tag?

These simple questions will help you make deliberate, thoughtful choices about every dialogue tag in your manuscript.
Putting It All Together

Let's see how these principles work in an actual scene. Here's an example that incorporates varied tags, action beats, and untagged dialogue to create a dynamic conversation:
Mark paced in front of the window. "You told them we'd do it?"
"I didn't have a choice," Sarah said, shuffling the papers on her desk.
"There's always a choice. You just made the wrong one." He stopped pacing and glared at her.
"What would you have done? Tell the CEO we couldn't handle it?"
"Yes! Exactly that!" he exclaimed.
Sarah leaned forward, her voice dropping to a whisper. "This project could make our careers. Or are you not interested in that promotion anymore?"
"That's not fair."
"Life rarely is." She returned to her papers, her shoulders tense.
Mark sighed and sank into the chair across from her desk. "How long do we have?"
"Two weeks."
"Two—" He laughed, but there was no humor in it. "That's impossible."
"Maybe." Sarah looked up, meeting his eyes. "Or maybe it's just what we needed."

Notice how this scene combines several techniques:

    Basic tags ("said") for neutral dialogue
    Descriptive tags ("exclaimed," "sighed," "laughed") for emotional emphasis
    Action beats in place of tags ("stopped pacing and glared," "leaned forward," "returned to her papers")
    Untagged dialogue where the speaker is clear from context
    Combined approaches ("leaned forward, her voice dropping to a whisper")

This varied approach creates rhythm and keeps readers engaged while clearly conveying who's speaking and how they're feeling. The result is dialogue that feels authentic and dynamic, serving the scene's growing tension without calling attention to the mechanics behind it.
Your Dialogue Tag Challenge

Now that you understand the power and potential pitfalls of dialogue tags, it's time to put this knowledge into practice. Here's a simple three-step exercise to help you sharpen your dialogue tag skills:
Step 1: Analyze Your Current Work

Take a scene from your work in progress and highlight all the dialogue tags. Then ask yourself:

    Are you relying too heavily on "said" and "asked"?
    Do you have redundant tags that repeat emotions already clear in the dialogue?
    Could some tags be replaced with action beats for greater impact?
    Are there places where tags could be eliminated entirely?

This analysis will reveal your current patterns and help you identify opportunities for improvement.
Step 2: Experiment with Alternatives

Rewrite the same scene three different ways:

    Using primarily "said" and "asked"
    Using a variety of descriptive tags from different categories
    Using minimal tags but more action beats

Compare the three versions. Which feels most natural? Which best serves the emotional tone of your scene? The answer will vary depending on the scene's purpose and intensity.
Step 3: Find Your Balance

Armed with these insights, develop a personal approach to dialogue tags that enhances your unique voice as a writer. Remember, there's no single "right way" to use dialogue tags—only approaches that serve your story better than others.
Final Thoughts

Dialogue tags are like seasoning in cooking—the right amount enhances the flavor of your story, while too much or too little can spoil the dish. With practice, you'll develop an intuitive sense for when to use "said," when to use a more descriptive tag, and when to let the dialogue stand on its own.

The best dialogue feels so natural that readers forget they're reading at all. They're simply experiencing the conversation as it unfolds, completely immersed in your story world. Thoughtful use of dialogue tags is one of the key ingredients that creates this seamless reading experience.

Trust your readers' intelligence. They don't need to be told explicitly how every line is delivered—often they can infer it from the words themselves and the context you've created. Your job is to provide just enough guidance through tags to ensure clarity and emphasize emotional beats when needed.
