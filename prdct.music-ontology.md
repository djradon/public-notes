## Description

"To understand the Music Ontology it is somehow essential to understand its underlying ontology - the [[FRBR Ontology|prdct.frbr]] - with its 4 levels: [[frbr:Work, frbr:Expression, frbr:Manifestation, frbr:Item|t.library-science.work_expression_manifestation_item]], where MO derives from on each level.
Note: To bypass the levels from the most abstract level to a lower level, please use the property frbr:subject, which has a range of frbr:Endeavour (the superclass of the 4 levels concept). This enables, for example, a bypass from a mo:MusicalWork instance to a mo:SignalGroup instance. "
