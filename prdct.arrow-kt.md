- Arrow is a web framework for building web applications in the Kotlin programming language. It's designed for server-side development and can be used to create RESTful APIs, web applications, and more.
- Arrow provides abstractions and tools for building type-safe and functional applications. It promotes functional programming practices and is inspired by the Arrow library for Kotlin.
- It is not a front-end library like Astro or htmx but focuses on the back-end and server-side development.
