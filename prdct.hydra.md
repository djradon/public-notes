## Vision

Current APIs heavily rely on out-of-band information such as human-readable documentation and API-specific SDKs. However, this only allows for very simple and brittle clients that are hardcoded against specific APIs. Hydra, in contrast, is a set of technologies that allow to design APIs in a different manner, in a way that enables smarter clients.

## Details

- "Hydra consists of two key parts. There’s the all-important vocabulary mentioned above — known as the Hydra Core Vocabulary — but there’s also a format for referencing linked data (usually JSON-LD), also known as an RDF serialization format."
  - "as long as the consumer is familiar with the vocabulary being used, they can independently determine the meaning of a key-value pair without the need for external documentation."
