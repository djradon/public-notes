## Highlights

- to resist #enshittification, you have to impose switching costs on yourself.
- Whenever you take a measure during a moment of strength that guards against your own future self's weakness, you enter into a Ulysses Pact – think throwing away the Oreos when you start your diet. ^e2icfkgfoisp
- Anyone who believes that they will never be tempted is a danger to themselves and the people who rely on them. A belief you can never be tempted or coerced is like a belief that you can never be conned – it makes you more of a mark, not less.
- Plenty of people have commented that now that a VC is holding [[prdct.bluesky]]'s purse-strings, enshittification will surely follow (doubly so because the VC is called "Blockchain Capital," which, at this point, might as well be "Grifty Scam Caveat Emptor Capital").
