Not every name belongs to a kingdom, a mountain, or a legendary hero. Some names are smaller, more grounded. They’re painted on wooden signs, scratched onto alleyway walls, or passed from mouth to mouth in the market square.

A fantasy world doesn’t only need great city names, it also needs a tavern on the corner with a crooked doorway and a story behind its name. It needs a statue people walk past without looking up, and an alley with a name no one says after dark. These are the names that make a place feel real.
Street Names and the Shape of a City

Street names often come from function, history, or local habit. They might be named for the original purpose of the street, a person who once lived there, or an event that took place long ago.

    Butcher’s Row, Tanner’s Walk, or Millstone Lane are names born from trade.

    Queen’s Passage, Martyr’s Way, or Rookbridge Street are named from history or legacy.

    The Long Cut, Bleeder’s Alley, or Backstep Lane express lived experience.

Sometimes, the official name is a grand one, but locals call it something else entirely. What’s printed on a map might be Orlanthian Avenue, but everyone still calls it Gravedust Road because of a long-gone plague pit buried beneath the cobbles.

You can use street names to build tone, be it gritty, whimsical, historic, or eerie. The names don’t need explaining, but they can be used to tell stories from the past, or to foreshadow the future.
Taverns, Inns, and Signs That Swing in the Wind

Fantasy taverns are famous for their names, and rightly so. These are the places where stories start, gossip spreads, and unlikely strangers cross paths.

Some taverns might be named for a local legend, a joke, or a bit of folklore. They might reflect their location, or what stands in close proximity. They might hint at the kind of patrons you’ll find drinking there.

The Book and Mug may be frequented by scholars from the nearby university. The Tavern of the Clerics might stand in the shadow of a ruined cathedral. Perhaps your characters grip the hilts of their swords before stepping into The Deadly Monkey.
Statues, Monuments, and Public Memory

Public landmarks might be named for memory, or as an expression of authority. And they may boast more than one name. Because, when it comes to memories and power, everyone views things differently.

    A statue might be officially called The Honour of House Meridan, but locals fondly call it The Pointy Lady.

    A clocktower might be known as Dawn’s Ring, even though it hasn’t worked in decades.

    A ruined archway might be The Southern Gate, The Last Step, or simply The Bones.

These names can reflect nostalgia, sarcasm, reverence, or disdain. A grand monument might be mockingly renamed if the honoured figure fell from grace. A broken fountain might be remembered for the rude shape its shadow casts at sunset, rather than whatever dedication is carved into the base.

The way people refer to landmarks reveals their relationship with the past. It tells you whether memory is a point of pride, or something they wish to forget.
Shops, Smithies, and Everyday Language

Shops and workshops give you another chance to inject local character. Naming a business isn’t just about what it sells, it’s about the story the owner wants to tell (or the pun they couldn’t resist).

Kelem’s Copper & Candle. Twice-Bound Books. Old Marn’s Mostly Bread. The Honest Edge might be the name of a blacksmith’s shop where you’d best watch your purse. If Found, Return Here might have a range of stock that seems to change daily, with no obvious theme.

These names give your world texture. They show humour, history, and local voice. And they’re excellent places to plant cultural quirks; maybe certain colours, animals, or celestial events are considered lucky, and turn up repeatedly in shop names. Maybe some cities have naming guilds, and businesses must apply for an approved name.
Places That Don’t Appear on Maps

Some names are unofficial, a guarded secret, or known only to locals. The back stairs of the old temple might be Thief’s Way. A crossroads where bandits once struck could be called The Breakpoint. An overgrown garden might be Lady Rain’s Rest, even if no one remembers who Lady Rain was.

You don’t need to overuse this, but including just a few ‘invisible’ names creates a feeling of depth. It hints that the world existed before the maps were drawn, or that a second world exists within it.

And because these places don’t appear on signs or maps, they can also serve as hidden routes, secret histories, and great opportunities for storytelling. Why isn’t The Seamstress Gate marked on the city records anymore? Why does everyone avoid Brindle Nook after sunset? These are the names with ghosts in them.

You don’t need to name every single street or statue. But choosing a handful of everyday names, and making them feel specific, local, and slightly worn-in, helps your setting come alive.

In a richly built world, even the smallest names tell a story.
