- elements represent "anything", e.g. person, place, thing, event, a piece of lore, a chapter of a book
  - contain any number of wiki page, map, or whiteboard tabs

## [[c.Model.business]]

- SaaS, but "When a subscription lapses, project owners can continue to access their projects and see the contents, though they can no longer edit or create new things... Project guests can not view projects with lapsed subscriptions. Only the project creator can."
