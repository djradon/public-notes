- "If you’ve never tried to [“make your venture-backed startup profitable”], you probably under-appreciate just how psychologically demanding it is—in particular, how much fresh and unfettered thinking, win-win relationship building, emotional self-management, authentic conviction, earned self-trust, intellectual ambitiousness, and disciplined focus it requires."

-   Beyond “scheduling self care,” they need help powering through a week without rest for the sake of a valued endeavor.
