A cluttered cupboard of jumbled jottings in the form of a [[prdct.dendron]] vault.

**Warning**: links are all broken when viewed directly from github

## Purpose

This vault is the "[[learning-in-public|ar.swyx.learn-in-public]]" part of my Second Brain. It includes:

- [[topics: my personal wikipedia|t]]
- [[ideas|idea]]
- "resource notes", including highlights, thoughts and metadata, for various things:
  - [[addressable resources|ar]] (mostly articles and documentation)
  - [[books|book]]
  - [[communities|community]]
  - [[courses|course]]
  - [[event]]
  - [[games|game]]
  - [[locations|loc]]
  - [[organizations|org]]
  - [[people|user]]
  - [[products|prdct]]
  - [[recipes|recipe]]
  - [[videos: movies, tv episodes, etc|video]]
- [[comparisons|vs]]
- [[desiderata|wanted]]
- [[tags|tags]] which may refer to any and multiple (or none) of the above

In terms of the [[t.km.zettelkasten]] method, it's a commingling of literature notes with something Ahrens warned about: a "personal Wikipedia or a database" [1](book.how-to-take-smart-notes.md). 

In terms of [[t.tm.getting-things-done]], it's references, someday-maybe, next actions, and public projects
