## Features

- PubSub+ Event Broker enables event streaming that is fast, reliable and secure, and includes features like topic hierarchy and fine grained filtering, so users can easily publish and subscribe to specific subsets of data.
- PubSub+ Event Portal gives architects and developers an easy-to-use tool to design, discover, catalog and visualize EDA components (events, schemas, and applications and APIs). It also provides role-based access controls and supports the creation of “event-API products”, so event streams can be exposed and accessed by internal and external parties, as desired.
