  - need to collect more of the right data including creds
  - manual investigations lead to an incomplete outcome
  - "it's a whole new world", but our humans have a gap e.g. NTLM vs Kerberos

- Four Attributes of Success:
  - "Assumed Breach" posture
    - "boring" is what wins
    - "offensive posture" : what if? zero trust initiatives;
    - NIST-800 needs teeth
  - Understand What Normal Looks Like
    - "over 3/4 of attacks are using valid credentials"; compromised credentials
  - Embrace Automation
    - "They'll yell at me" is a real reason IT won't do things
  - Think Like the Business
    - speak to the business in a language they understand
    - adopt a risk-based approach for users, roles, and assets
    - respond to cybersecurity events the way a good business responds to market conditions
    - elevate cybersecurity as a strategic partner versus a cost center
    - constant team education and improvement
- Where to begin:
  - audit existing capabilities
  - assess your staff workflow and workloads
  - determine the most business-critical use cases by asking
    - can you support them with your existing skills, technology, data
    - are you mapping log sources and events to the mitre attach chain
    - "[[first times are interesting|idea.first-times-are-interesting]]"
  - communicate the business value you are driving
