## Features

- curates libraries and tools from across the ecosystem and composes them into one polished whole.
- Strong defaults, weakly held. Biff is designed to be taken apart and modified, so it doesn't get in the way as your needs evolve.
- REPL made easy: Changes are evaluated whenever you save a file. Connect to a production REPL and develop your whole app on the fly.
