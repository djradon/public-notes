This weekend, the Stanford
ice hockey team will play its
third consecutive set of home
games, hosting Northern Ari
zona on Friday evening at 7
p.m. and San Jose State on Sat
urday at 7:40 p.m. Leading the
Cardinal through an increas
ingly difficult schedule, head
coach Ernie Ferrari expects
this weekend's battles to be
hard-fought and intense.
"I didn't think our play was
particularly deficient when we
lost to Utah State, but then San
.Jose defeated them handily,"
Ferrari said. "So at practice on
Monday night, I worked our
guys pretty hard. Pain is a
great motivator, so I think we'll
be up for this weekend's chal
lenge."
While two wins would push
the team's record to a
formidable 5-1, two losses
would leave the Cardinal at 3-3,
and severely handicap its pur
suit of a berth at the national
tournament.
One complicating factor in
this weekend's effort may be
the depletion of the Cardinal
defensive corps. With sopho

more Matt Blythe's medical
status in limbo and returning
senior Eric Haug away inter
viewing at medical schools, the
team will be expecting a stellar
defensive performance from
both its goaltenders and its
remaining defenseman.
"Eric is the man," said for
ward Mintak Joo. "When some
one goes in one-on-one with
him, you know that guy will be
coming out disappointed at
best, injured at worst â€” or
injured at best, depending on
how you look at it."
Ice-time figures reveal the
Cardinal's heavy reliance on
Haug. In four games this season,
he has logged much more ice
time than bench time, something
extraordinarily rare in a game as
aerobically demanding as hock
ey. Haug himself acknowledges
the hyperbole of his situation.
"What may look like unorthodox
play on my part may really be
exhausted delirium," he said. "I
don't know how long I can keep
that up."
Hut team captain Stefan
Teitge is confident in the team's
potency, even without Haug
and Blythe. "Man for man,
we're better than any team in
the league," he said.
