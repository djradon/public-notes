  - "Unusual features include the monochrome esthetics, sidenotes instead of footnotes on wide windows, efficient drop caps/​smallcaps, collapsible sections, automatic inflation-adjusted currency, Wikipedia-style link icons & infoboxes, custom syntax highlighting⁠, extensive local archives to fight linkrot, and an ecosystem of “popup”/​“popin” annotations & previews of links for frictionless browsing—the net effect of hierarchical structures with collapsing and instant popup access to excerpts enables iceberg-like pages where most information is hidden but the reader can easily drill down as deep as they wish."
