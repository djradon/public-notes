## description 

- a more general form of a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) that can include a wider range of characters, such as those from non-Latin scripts. It serves as a unique identifier for resources on the web, similar to a URL but more expansive in character support. IRIs are often used in linked data and semantic web contexts to uniquely reference entities, enabling precise identification and data integration across diverse systems. (chatgpt)
