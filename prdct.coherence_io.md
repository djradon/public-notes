## Features

- High-fidelity interpolation with historical states.
- Build extremely large worlds with 64-bit world origin shifting.
- two types of replicated environments - Rooms and Worlds. Rooms are best for session-based multiplayer gameplay that takes place in a short-lived environment. Think of a tennis match, a first-person shooter map, or a race track session. The players go in, play until the end, the results get recorded and the Room is closed. Worlds on the other hand are long-lived and permanent
- use the Steam Datagram Relay to run your game with zero server costs.
