## t.2024.03.16.17

- is the solution to all my worrying about [[idea.instances-are-sometimes-classes]] literally just everything non-specific is a class? like topics are classes? things that are just instances:
  - documents
  - concrete individuals (but not characters/characterizations)
  - locations. (but what about [[locale.North-America.coastal]]?)
    - it depends: 
      - "coastal north america" taken as a whole is an instance
      - "coastal north-american locations" is a class
  - events (but not event types)

## t.2024.08.20.12

- put another way, non-leaf nodes in a hierarchy are classes
  - not all trees are hierarchies, see [[prdct.abc-ontology]]
- topics are specific, and not necessarily classes (unless the topic is a class, say, "north american locations"). just because you have sub-topics or sub-whatever (i.e., hierarchy) doesn't make something a class. locations aren't classes, location-types or even location-collections are. 
  - for my dendron notes, I've overloaded topics, such that they are both classes and instances.
