## t.2024.03.16.17

- is the solution to all my worrying about [[idea.instances-are-sometimes-classes]] literally just everything non-specific is a class? like topics are classes? things that are just instances:
  - documents
  - concrete individuals (but not characters/characterizations)
  - locations. (but what about [[locale.North-America.coastal]]?)
    - it depends: 
      - "coastal north america" taken as a whole is an instance
      - "coastal north-american locations" is a class
  - events (but not event types)
