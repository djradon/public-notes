## fabulary vs fabularia

@chatgpt.4o:

"Fabulary" and "Fabularia" are two variations that maintain the essence of "fabula" while offering slightly different connotations:

### Fabulary:
- **Connotation**: "Fabulary" suggests a more compact or structured collection of events. The suffix "-ary" often implies a collection or something akin to a library (e.g., "glossary," "dictionary"). Thus, "fabulary" could evoke the idea of a structured, perhaps even indexed, collection of narrative events.
- **Use Case**: It might be used to describe a systematic catalog or organized record of the events in a story, potentially emphasizing their organization or categorization.

### Fabularia:
- **Connotation**: "Fabularia" has a more expansive and perhaps formal tone. The suffix "-aria" can give the word a sense of being more elaborate or grand, possibly hinting at a comprehensive collection or even a domain of events within a narrative.
- **Use Case**: This term might be used to suggest a more extensive or rich compendium of events, one that encompasses the full range of narrative possibilities or a detailed chronicle of a story's events.

### Comparison:
- **Scope**: "Fabularia" feels broader and more expansive, suggesting a richer or more detailed collection, while "Fabulary" feels more focused, structured, or systematic.
- **Formality**: "Fabularia" might be perceived as more formal or grandiose, whereas "Fabulary" might be seen as more practical or utilitarian.
- **Application**: "Fabularia" could be more suited for use in contexts where you want to emphasize the depth or richness of the narrative chronicle, while "Fabulary" might be better for contexts that emphasize structure, order, or organization.

### Summary:
- **Fabulary**: A structured, organized collection of narrative events, with a focus on systematic presentation.
- **Fabularia**: A more expansive, possibly more formal or grand, compendium of narrative events, suggesting richness and depth. 

Your choice between the two would depend on the tone and scope you wish to convey in your project.
