## Abstract

In this paper we consider the types of community networks that are most often codified within the Semantic Web. We propose the recognition of a new structure which fulfils the definition of community used outside the Semantic Web. We argue that the properties inherent in a community allow additional processing to be done with the described rela- tionships existing between entities within the community network. Taking an existing online community as a case study we describe the ontologies and applications that we developed to support this community in the Semantic Web environment and discuss what lessons can be learnt from this exercise and applied in more general settings.

## Highlights

### Creating an Ontomedia Application

The user will not actually be able to edit the shared entities, instead it will act as a template of values for a new instance. This new instance will belong to the user and exist in their ontomedia:context but will identify itself as having a shadow-of relationship to the instance used as a template.
