## sflow description

### dave

Semantic Flow is a set of conventions and helpful utilities for managing IRI namespaces and RDF dataset distributions on github or gitlab

### chatgpt

Got it. If you need any specific conventions or utility examples fleshed out for Semantic Flow, just let me know!

## SFNamespaceRepo

### dave

I'll abbreviate references to Semantic Flow as "sf". Instead of "ManagedNamespaceRepo", maybe "SFNamespaceRepo"? Thinking about the sf mechanics, I want multiple git repos to be able to contribute their NamedIndividuals to a namespace, so within a SFNamespaceRepo, the hierarchy looks like:

- /docs (the generated semantic flow site that github pages points to)
- /contributing-repos (a folder where checked out repos live; they'll be scanned for IRIs in the SFNamespaceRepo
- / (the root which contains configuration files and the static site generator code)
- /templates (contains templates which the SSG applies to NamedIndividuals based on configuration)

Regarding templates, the contributing-repos should also be able to supply templates and template-mappings, but the SFNamespaceRepo can choose whether to honor those, use its own mappings, or try to combine things.

### chatgpt

This layout sounds modular and flexible, especially with the SFNamespaceRepo’s control over templates and mappings. This should work well for accommodating multiple contributors while keeping control over the namespace’s presentation and structure. If you want any specifics on managing template precedence or mappings across repositories, I can help brainstorm solutions.

## eleventy vs metalsmith

### dave

Trying to choose an SSG. metalsmith-ldschema actually seems close to what I want. Help me choose eleventy, metalsmith or some other javascript-based ssg.

### chatgpt

If you're leaning toward RDF compatibility, here’s a breakdown of Metalsmith, Eleventy, and other options:

1. **Metalsmith (with metalsmith-ldschema)**:
   - **Pros**: Metalsmith’s plugin-driven architecture allows you to process RDF with plugins like `metalsmith-ldschema`, which can apply linked data schema transformations. It’s particularly suited for structured data handling and could be customized to parse and mint IRIs directly from RDF datasets in your SFNamespaceRepo.
   - **Cons**: While flexible, Metalsmith might lack some of the markdown features and built-in templates that others offer out-of-the-box, making it more of a DIY solution.

2. **Eleventy**:
   - **Pros**: Eleventy is popular for its simplicity and speed. Its templating support is extensive (Nunjucks, Liquid, etc.), and it’s highly configurable for generating static pages. While Eleventy doesn’t directly support RDF, you could preprocess RDF datasets and output JSON/Markdown for Eleventy to use.
   - **Cons**: Requires more setup for RDF and linked data, as you’d need to add custom scripts for RDF parsing, potentially complicating your workflow.

3. **Other Options**:
   - **Gatsby**: If you want React, Gatsby has plugins for loading JSON and handling complex data, which could be useful if you're willing to preprocess RDF to JSON. It’s more opinionated than Metalsmith, though.
   - **Hexo**: Lightweight and easy for generating Markdown-based sites. Limited linked data support, so it would require significant customization to integrate RDF.

**Recommendation**: Given your focus on RDF and structured data, **Metalsmith with metalsmith-ldschema** is likely the best fit, as it’s closest to the semantic and data-handling capabilities you need. If you want a more templating-friendly solution without RDF specifics, **Eleventy** paired with a custom RDF-to-JSON preprocessor would be a solid alternative.
