## Description

Prefect is an orchestration and observability platform for building, observing, and triaging workflows. It's the simplest way to transform Python code into an interactive workflow application.

Prefect allows you to expose your workflows through an API so teams dependent on you can programmatically access your pipelines, business logic, and more. Prefect also allows you to standardize workflow development and deployment across your organization.

With Prefect, you can build resilient, dynamic workflows that react to the world around them and recover from unexpected changes. With just a few decorators, Prefect supercharges your code with features like automatic retries, distributed execution, scheduling, caching, and much more.
