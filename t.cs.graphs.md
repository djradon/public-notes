    - Directed edges have a subtle impact on the use of the term neighbors. If an edge goes from A to B, then B is said to be A’s neighbor; but the reverse is not true. A is not a neighbor of B unless there is an edge from B to A. In other words, a node’s neighbors are the set of nodes that can be reached from that node.
