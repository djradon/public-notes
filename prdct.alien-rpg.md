## Game System

[[game-system.year-zero-engine-yze]] has been customized to reflect the themes of the Alien universe, focusing on survival horror, stress mechanics, and cinematic play. Players roll pools of dice based on character attributes and skills, with successes determined by rolling sixes. The stress mechanic adds a unique twist, as accumulating stress gives you more dice to roll but also increases the chance of panic during high-pressure situations. This combination of mechanics helps recreate the tense atmosphere of the Alien franchise. (chatgpt)
