## vs RDF

- The RDF vocabulary provides you terms for defining/describing instances.

The RDFS vocabulary provides you terms for defining/describing classes.

## vs OWL

> OWL = RDFS + more semantic features like cardinalities, union, intersection and more reasoning and inferring possibilities.
It may be sufficient to use RDFS if you just need to manipulate class hierarchies and data-types, but if you need more specific semantics (DL-based) , OWL is a better option.
