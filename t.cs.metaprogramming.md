  - "Dynamically typed languages like Python and Ruby make it easy to manipulate the program with other code, sometimes derisively called monkey patching. In statically typed languages like Java and Scala, metaprogramming is more constrained and less common. Itâ€™s still useful for solving many advanced design problems, but more formality is required to separate compile-time versus runtime manipulation."
