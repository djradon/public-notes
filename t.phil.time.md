## The Cruel Arithmetic of Time

Before neuroscientists mapped temporal perception mechanics, the ancient Greeks recognized the difference between chronological time (chronos) and subjective time (kairos). Kairos carried the meaning of “the right or critical moment,” with etymological roots in archery—not just when an arrow may be fired with sufficient force to penetrate a target, but the precise moment when all conditions—wind, distance, target position—aligned perfectly.
