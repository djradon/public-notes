## Thoughts

- just use components/aspects/roles
- just because OBO and DOLCE are single-inheritance doesn't mean multiple-inheritance is bad

## Highlights

- "Nicola Guarino criticizes the careless usage of is-a relationships without enough ontological consideration as is-a overloading [2] and proposes an ontology development methodology, called OntoClean, which defines concepts based on meta- properties such as rigidity and anti-rigidity"
