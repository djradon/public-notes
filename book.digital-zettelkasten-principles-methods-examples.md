## [[p.hasHighlight]]

- [[idea.beware-archivism]]
- The activities involved in managing [your zettelkasten] also help solidify your memory, so it needs less jogging in the first place... Search engines and the internet are not a substitute for your notes. Your notes contain more than just simple facts, managing your notes builds your memory, and your notes help you store and develop ideas in-progress.

## [[p.hasCitation]]

- "The archivist asks: Which keyword is the most fitting? A writer asks: In which circumstances will I want to stumble upon this note, even if I forget about it?" [[book.how-to-take-smart-notes]]
