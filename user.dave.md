### Bombora

For over 30 years, David has been helping organizations wrangle their technology, improve their processes, and nurture their people. He is currently responsible for Bombora’s technology and security operations.

Before Bombora, David was the Director of Technology Operations at Madison Logic, where he managed the tech team and, as he’s done for Bombora, grew their IT footprint from nothing to a highly-available, highly-modern global organization. Before that, he drove innovation as Lead Technologist at IndustryBrains and as CTO for the Slamdance Film Festival. He also launched a video game design course at Stanford’s Digital Media Academy and developed a high school Computational Physics curriculum while teaching at Packer Collegiate in Brooklyn.

David’s technology interests include graph databases, agent-based simulation, and time travel. He holds a B.Sc in Symbolic Systems from Stanford University.
