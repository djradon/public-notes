Stanford's ice hockey team split its
games this past weekend, winning 5-3
against Northern Arizona's grinding
team on Friday night, but falling 9-5
to nemesis San Jose State on Satur
day. The Cardinal now stands at 4-2, a
record which assistant coach Eric
Israel calls "respectable, but not com
pelling." Indeed, with an upcoming
weekend series at almost unassailable
Arizona, Stanford faces the discourag
ing prospect of a .500 mark after four
promising weeks of play.
Friday night, the Cardinal was in
high form, beating the Lumberjacks
and receiving a rock-solid perfor
mance by netminder Nick Lemieux.
The freshman goaltender repelled
shot after shot.
"He played really well in his first
game," said team captain Stefan
Teitge, "but we thought that was just

a fluke. After Friday night's game,
Nick has made it clear that he is the
new force to be reckoned with in the
Pacific 8 Conference."
Other standouts in the match
included junior David Richardson,
who has been playing center ice on the
checking line this year.
"Dave's a killer," said freshman
Tom Terbell. "Dave's a mess. But I
can honestly say, even though I just
joined the team a few weeks ago, that
Friday night's game was the best
game of his career. [Head] coach
[Ernie] Ferrari stopped yelling at him
and even gave him some time on the
penalty kill."
But on Saturday, the Cardinal
played undisciplined hockey. After
falling behind 4-1 in the first period,
the team pulled off a comeback, rally
ing to tie the score at five going into
the third frame. Unfortunately, the
Spartans scored four unanswered
goals before the clock expired, leaving
the Cardinal thoroughly deflated.
"I'm feeling a bit acrimonious about
the loss," Ferrari said, "especially since
we'll be playing the toughest team in
the West this weekend.
At Arizona, they usually have about
5,000 belligerent fans. If I have any say
in it, there are going to be about 5,000
people crying in the streets next Satur
day night."
