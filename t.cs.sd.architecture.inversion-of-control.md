## description:

- Inversion of Control is a widely-used architectural concept that's one of the distinguishing characteristics of frameworks, as opposed to libraries. Whereas typical flow of control has app-specific code call shared code (in a library), Inversion of Control reverses this relationship, and has shared code (in a framework) call app-specific code instead.
