## Description

- This document presents a formalization of the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO) in first- order logic. This formalization is documented by means of three complementary representations: (i) a representation in standard [[prdct.common-logic]] using the CLIF syntax; (ii) a representation in natural language; and, when applicable, (iii) a UML-based diagrammatic representation. The presented formalization is supported by consistency and satisfiability checks performed through automated proofing tools.

n- coded in the ontologies, to include more abstract and philosophical semantic relations and semiotic matching, to take advantage of structural features of the ontologies and axioms in order to better compare their formal definitions, and to take advantage of background knowledge from external resources targeting subsumption and other semantic relations. These have to be combined with logical reasoning techniques for guarantee the consis- tency of the generated alignments. The current approaches have to be hence revised to better deal with the specificities of matching foundational ontologies.
