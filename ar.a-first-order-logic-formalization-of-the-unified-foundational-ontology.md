## Description

- This document presents a formalization of the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO) in first- order logic. This formalization is documented by means of three complementary representations: (i) a representation in standard [[prdct.common-logic]] using the CLIF syntax; (ii) a representation in natural language; and, when applicable, (iii) a UML-based diagrammatic representation. The presented formalization is supported by consistency and satisfiability checks performed through automated proofing tools.
