- [[c.software.rules-engine]]

## Cons

- "lacks of a complex execution model: there is no proper notion of a module hence you cannot perfectly isolate one rule from another, or to properly partition the working memory. As the rule base increases in complexity, it will become harder and harder to understand which rules trigger and why."
