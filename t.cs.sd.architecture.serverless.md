## Issues

- "once the rose-tinted sunglasses of the ‘free tier’ come off we all must come to grips with what serverless really is: an attempt to lock in customers to a few proprietary services." ^s9iot2yvvndt
- "The truth about serverless was that it was never really serverless. It was developing on someone else’s server and that involves risk." ^dirgz2zn129f
