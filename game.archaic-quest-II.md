## Thoughts

- commands can take indirect objects and prepositions, e.g. "look [at] crate" vs "look in crate"ge
- "look 2.crate" 
- I've been so ready to give up the [[t.cs.game.persistent-room]] thing... with good auto-DMing, it shouldn't be necessary. 
- "Don't forget to read descriptions and pay attention it's easy to miss something interesting if you rush." - uh, this is a bad sign. i have to read all these boring descriptions. And they persist each time I come back to the "room".
