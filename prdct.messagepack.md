## Comparisons

### vs [[prdct.protobuf]]

- "The Protocol Buffers format provides a significantly more compact transmission format than MessagePack because it doesn't transmit field names. However, while JSON and MessagePack aim to serialize arbitrary data structures with type tags, Protocol Buffers require a schema to define the data types."
