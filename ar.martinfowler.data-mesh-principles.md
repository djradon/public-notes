## Highlights

- data mesh follows a distributed system architecture; a collection of independent data products, with independent lifecycle, built and deployed by likely independent teams.
  - However for the majority of use cases, to get value in forms of higher order datasets, insights or machine intelligence there is a need for these independent data products to interoperate; to be able to correlate them, create unions, find intersections, or perform other graphs or set operations on them at scale.
    - For any of these operations to be possible, a data mesh implementation requires a governance model that embraces decentralization and domain self-sovereignty, interoperability through global standardization, a dynamic topology and most importantly automated execution of decisions by the platform.
