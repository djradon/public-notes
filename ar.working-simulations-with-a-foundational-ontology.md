title: Working Simulations with a Foundational Ontology
desc: 'outline a foundational simulation ontology (FSO) that models simulations themselves so that not only the domain-specific models can be aligned to a standardized upper level, but also scenario design for ontology-based simulations can be performed by applying state of the art ontology engineering principles'

## Highlights

- for more complex models, sequential ([[t.cs.simulation.discrete-event]]) simulation will exhibit poor runtime performance (compared to [[t.cs.agents.agent-based-simulation]])
- " our choice of employing [[prdct.dolce]] as foundational ontology was motivated by the need to enable agents to adapt their conceptualizations and create new ones on the fly because several dedicated DOLCE-modules provide a corresponding framework"
- we have chosen to employ a set of ontological modules which have been designed along with the DOLCE framework, namely:
• the [[prdct.ontology-of-information-objects]];
• the Ontology of Plans [10];
• the Core Software Ontology [29];
• the Descriptions and Situations module [13].
