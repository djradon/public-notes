title: Working Simulations with a Foundational Ontology
desc: 'outline a foundational simulation ontology (FSO) that models simulations themselves so that not only the domain-specific models can be aligned to a standardized upper level, but also scenario design for ontology-based simulations can be performed by applying state of the art ontology engineering princi- ples'

## Highlights

- for more complex models, sequential ([[t.cs.simulation.discrete-event]]) simulation will exhibit poor runtime performance (compared to [[t.cs.agents.agent-based-simulation]])
