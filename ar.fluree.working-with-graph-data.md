## Highlights

- "the notion of an entity as a container is useful and it feels intuitive. If we're modeling customer data, we want to be able to talk about a customer as an actual thing that has properties or attributes. The resolution here is to just acknowledge that you can impose that kind of organization onto an RDF graph, but it's a convenience for your thinking and communication, and not something that's technically reflected in the way RDF data is structured.

We also need to contend with the practical fact that we are representing our data using JSON objects, which actually are containers. How do we bridge this gap between RDF's notion of data as a non-hierarchical collection of nodes and arcs, and JSON's inherently hierarchical structure?"
