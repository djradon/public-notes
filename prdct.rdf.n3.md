## vs Trig

- N3 is not directly compatible with [[prdct.rdf.trig]] as it does not support [the trig] graph statement notation.
- Nevertheless, since N3 supports graph terms as part of regular N3 statements, authors can use the N3 Named Graphs extension; this extension allows associating names or identifiers with graph terms.
