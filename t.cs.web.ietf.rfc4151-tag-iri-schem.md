## [[p.hasHighlight]]

-   Identifiers are likely to be unique across space and time, and come from a practically inexhaustible supply.
-   Identifiers are relatively convenient for humans to mint (create), read, type, remember etc.
-   No central registration is necessary, at least for holders of domain names or email addresses; and there is negligible cost to mint each new identifier.
-   The identifiers are independent of any particular resolution scheme.
