## Comparisons

### Saving Throws vs Ability Checks

-  Now, technically, there is no such thing as "skill check". There is n ability check, that can be done either using just an ability by itself, or using a specific skill related to that ability. Those are called "skill checks" in the informal vernacular, and are not actually called that in the books.

Ability checks are, simply put, is when you want to do something to the world around you - climb a tree, lift a boulder, hide in the darkness, seduce a dragon, etc. Now, saving throws, following that same analogy, are made when the world is doing something to you - a trap opens under your feet, a spell is being cast on you, you ingest poison, etc.
