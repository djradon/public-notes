### modding

- "easily it can be modded which puts it's automation above that of what I've witnessed in any other VTT. "
- " there is a thing about platforms where the one that is pretty popular and moddable attracts the best modders, which means it becomes much better and attracts more great modders and users.. Foundry has snowballed to a point where a DM who is a bit technical and wants to add mods has an amazing variety of options. "
