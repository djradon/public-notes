## Highlights

- Using RDF-Star simply encouraged poor modeling practice.
- We abused RDF-Star because we used a facility for making statements about statements to instead make statements about doctor visits or airline flights.
- "RDF-Star really is important, because it lets us address a lot of things about data usage that arenâ€™t addressed in most data systems, including graph stores, document stores and relational stores, at all. If we want to know whether we want to trust a datum, a good way to figure that out is to look at its source. RDF-Star will let us do this directly. If we have some confidence in our data (or lack of confidence), we can annotate statements with some measure of confidence; maybe a probability estimate or some fuzzy measure. Temporal and bi-temporal reasoning is important in many situations; RDF-Star provides a way we can represent time scales on statement, in a standard, interoperable way."
- There are probably more creative ways to appropriately use RDF-Star; some that come to mind when modeling policy is jurisdiction; under what jurisdictions is this policy statement valid? For data governance, who is allowed to know the content of this statement?
