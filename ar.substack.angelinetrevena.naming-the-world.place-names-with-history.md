Place names are like fossils in a language. They’re left behind by settlers, conquerors, pilgrims, and storytellers, passed down like heirlooms, or changed like half-remembered tales. A place might be named after a god, a landmark, or a battle victory. It might be renamed a dozen times, each one layering another history over the land.

Naming your cities, valleys, mountains, and ruins gives you a way to tell stories with just a name. A name can suggest a place’s age, who once lived there, or what people fear might still live there.
The Name at the Beginning

Most places start with a simple need: simply to be known. The first name a place is given tends to be practical: who founded the place, what’s nearby, what it’s for.

    A village built beside a bend in the river might become Riverhook.

    A trade post on the northern road might be called Northernkeep.

    An old shrine might still be known as Saint Elarin’s Hollow, long after belief in that religion has faded.

These names often reflect the priorities of the people naming them. Conquerors might name for glory. Farmers might name for terrain. Pilgrims might name for the divine.

Over time, the origin may be forgotten, even when the name remains. Consider who has the authority or opportunity to name places first. The native population? Colonists or nomads? Priests or scholars? Did names arise organically, or were they chosen for a certain purpose?
The Name It Became

Language changes over time, and stories about a place shift and evolve. A city might burn and be rebuilt, a forest might be cleared for farmland. Even when the landscape doesn’t change, what people call a place might.

Maybe the bustling port once known as Greyharbour is now Ashendock, after a fire gutted its warehouses. Maybe Sapphire Moor, once famed for its rich mines, only conjours up memories of battlefields now, and locals refer to the area as Deadgrass. Perhaps an ancient capital has no official name anymore, but people whisper tales of The Broken Seat.

These second names—folk names, cruel nicknames, shortened slang—add flavour and potential friction. They show how people interact with a place, signalling affection, resentment, pride, or loss.
One Place, Many Names

In a culturally layered world, the same location might be known by different names to different groups of people. Perhaps a formal one for diplomats, a rough nickname used by merchants, and an old name still muttered by those who remember better days.

    The people who live there might call the lake Talenvir.

    Traders might call it The Silver Mirror.

    The neighbouring empire refers to it, dismissively, as Borderwater.

    The old name, in a language now mostly forgotten, was Haluhari; The Soul of the Land.

Each version of the name says something about who’s speaking, what their relationship to the place is, and what perspective they bring.

This kind of multiplicity creates both depth and a history of conflict. Whose version is accepted on the map? Whose name was overwritten by another? Is it a political act to insist on using the older name?

When done intentionally, multiple names can hint at colonisation, resistance, trade influence, faith, or migration. They show your world isn’t static; it’s layered and contested, and very much alive.
Landscape and Language

Many place names are rooted in geography, reflecting natural features, terrain, or climate. These names often sound practical or descriptive, but they can still be beautiful.

You might have a map with The Wind Flats, Stonebarrow Peaks, Greenreach, or The Crooked River. Your map might include Tor Varn, Dunlight, and Mirefens. Remember to match your names to the region’s language, tone, and your story’s genre.

You can create coherence in your map by repeating structures or fragments. If you have a group of islands called The Briar Chain, you might have individual names like Northbriar, Redsbriar, and Briar’s End. By simply following a handful of naming rules or repeated roots your names will feel like they belong to the same linguistic system.

Geographic names also anchor your setting, and let your audience picture terrain without exposition. A name like Scragcliffs paints an instant image. Brightmere suggests sunlight on a lake. Hollow Vane feels colder, more haunted, just by its sound.
Belief, Folklore, and Legend

Some places are named not for what they are, but for what people believe about them.

    A spring called The Widow’s Well, said to grant wishes if visited under moonlight.

    A path named The Wyrm’s Spine, even though no one has seen a dragon in generations.

    A cave known as The Silence, where everyone passes the entrance as fast as possible, without knowing why.

These names suggest stories—maybe half-true, maybe invented entirely—but they shape how people treat the place. A forest called The Weeping Wood might be avoided, even if it’s perfectly safe. The God-Tower might be just a mountain, but try convincing the villagers of that.

You don’t need to explain every one of these names. In fact, it can be more powerful when you don’t. Let readers wonder what happened at Last Lantern. Let players ask questions about The Noose Tree. The name itself can carry the story.
Renaming Through Power

Sometimes, naming isn’t about memory, it’s about control. In worlds with shifting borders, colonisation, or political upheaval, place names can become battlegrounds.

    An empire might rename a conquered city to erase its past.

    A revolution might strip out all references to the old regime.

    A sacred site might have a hidden, older name that’s kept alive only in secret.

In these cases, the name of a place becomes a statement, revealing who holds power, who lost it, and who refuses to let go of the past. If your world includes war, empire, rebellion, or collapse, don’t forget that place names change too. They are part of the landscape, but also part of the narrative.

When you name places with care, you don’t just fill a map. You fill the world with echoes. With memory and mystery. Let your readers feel the weight of every forgotten city and every hidden landmark as they wander through the world you’ve built.
