- dave: Remember: I'm trying to develop a static-site generator called "Semantic Flow" that takes ontologies defined in RDF and/or conforming RDF data files and generates a static site to be hosted on GitHub pages that includes HTML-based index files (that can be based on a template or customized as necessary) that describe identified resources and link to raw RDF data files (possibly in multiple formats) that can be access by semantically-aware applications.
