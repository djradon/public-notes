## Highlights

### Why a new model is needed

- library ontologies include library business rules
- this proposal implements a theory of ontology development known as _minimal ontological commitment_. ([Gruber, 1993](https://journal.code4lib.org/articles/16491#note9))
  - minimum semantics also means that the various community-supported vocabularies that derive from these terms may not be interoperable between them when their community-specific constraints are applied.

### CWO/OpenWEMI

- [[prdct.openwemi]] metadata description of a created resource does not require the existence of the full WEMI stack, but it does require adherence to the logical order of the entities.
- The relationships can be between any more abstract levels in the stack to those more concrete.
- These entities are not defined as disjoint, as they are in FRBR. Disjointness is a restriction that would limit the ways that the entities can be defined and whether they can share attributes
