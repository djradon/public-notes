## Cons

- does not lend itself very well to the streaming nature of event brokers like NATS Streaming and Kafka â€“ I think Topos is a better fit for that.

## vs MassTransit

- https://code-maze.com/rebus-dotnet/
- Rebus aims to be more lightweight and easier to configure than MassTransit. It also supports some queuing systems that MassTransit does not, such as Azure Storage Queues and MSMQ, and even relational databases such as SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and MySQL.
