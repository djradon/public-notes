- "Skald drops you right into a familiar but well realised world without beating you over the head with (ugh) “lore” or culture you can loosely infer by context."
- "A straightforward d20 system dictates combat, with rolls to hit vs dodge, damage rolls vs "soak", and a big emphasis on positioning thanks to flanking bonuses, limited combat space, and a lack of ability to pass through friendlies. A D&D-ish action economy makes extra attack feats very powerful, but so too are roguey passive skills like free disengage (freely stepping out of melee range, which otherwise ends a turn) and swapping places."
- "Skald is out of the Ultima lineage -- a bespoke non-random hand-crafted RPG campaign and world for the player to poke around in, with re-playing only necessary if things go very badly or the player wants to try out different possibilities and character types. This family tree of games goes to Baldur's Gate 3 and the like, though again Skald is a throwback to an older branch. (As was Moonring, another recent Ultima-like)"

## Cons

- You can take all this description as enthusiastic. Please do, while I frown through a list of bugs and annoyances: Information screens sometimes drop to about three frames per second (as did one battle). Nuisances like being unable to split or sell partial stacks are part of why I hoarded so much food (and having two identical magic items is worthless as they don't stack and won't separate), characters occasionally become uselessly stuck targeting one enemy but refuse to attack them. There's a tendency for clicks to sometimes just not register, and no order confirmation system so misclicks can be punishing (and it's sometimes unclear where a spell is targeted). You can't leave the levelling screen to check a character's stats, and I had to bin an entire mage because a bug skipped past his spell selection menu. Fixable, sure, especially the handful of trivial oversights that are symptomatic of a tiny development team, and perhaps even by release. But still a pest.
