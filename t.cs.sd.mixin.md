## [[p.supportedBy]]

- #c-sharp (since C# 8.0, by means of default methods of interfaces)
- [[t.cs.languages.scala]] Scala has a rich type system and Traits are a part of it which helps implement mixin behaviour.
- [[t.cs.languages.rust]] Rust makes extensive use of mixins via traits. Traits, like in Scala, allow users to implement behaviours for a defined type. They are also used for generics and dynamic dispatch, which allow for types with same traits to be used interchangeably statically or dynamically at runtime respectively
