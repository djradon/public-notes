## Issues

- where is the data? 

## [[p.supportedBy]]

- c# (since C# 8.0, by means of default methods of interfaces), but no data?
- scala Scala has a rich type system and Traits are a part of it which helps implement mixin behaviour.
  - but "Traits are Mixins just with some slightly different properties from a programming language designers point of view like Mixins require [[t.cs.sd.mixin.linearization]] while Traits are flattened and Traits traditionally donâ€™t contain states."
- #rust Rust makes extensive use of mixins via traits. Traits, like in Scala, allow users to implement behaviours for a defined type. They are also used for generics and dynamic dispatch, which allow for types with same traits to be used interchangeably statically or dynamically at runtime respectively
- java default methods for interfaces (could work if every actor had a weak dictionary or whatever)
- javascript

```
// copy the methods
Object.assign(User.prototype, sayHiMixin);
```
