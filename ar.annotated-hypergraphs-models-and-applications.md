- #summary
  - In this article, we consider an important and relatively general class of metadata in which nodes are assigned roles in each edge
- [[p.hasSummaryPoints]]
  - networks cannot be represented by via the classical paradigm of dyadic graphs without a significant loss of model fidelity.
  - "Roles are assigned neither to nodes or to edges, but rather to node-edge pairs."
- [[p.provokedThoughts]]
  - "edges in which the same node appears twice are not allowed" 
    - why not?
      - seems like just for "experimental convenience"
    - "It is difficult to find a modeling justification for hypergraphs with role-degenerate edges, but degenerate edges may have modeling applications"
    - role-degenerate: same node v appears twice in e, with the same role.  
  - "polyadic interactions" = "n-ary relations"
  - "nodes of high degree tend to connect to other nodes of high degree"
