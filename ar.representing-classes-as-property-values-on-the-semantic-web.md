## Abstract

This document addresses the issue of using classes as property values in OWL and RDF Schema. It is often convenient to put a class (e.g., Animal) as a property value (e.g., topic or book subject) when building an ontology. While OWL Full and RDF Schema do not put any restriction on using classes as property values, in OWL DL and OWL Lite most properties cannot have classes as their values. We illustrate the direct approach for representing classes as property values in OWL-Full and RDF Schema. We present various alternative mechanisms for representing the required information in OWL DL and OWL Lite. For each approach, we discuss various considerations that the users should keep in mind when choosing the best approach for their purposes.
