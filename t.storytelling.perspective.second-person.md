- addresses the audience, like "Choose Your Own Adventure", [[c.software.game-framework.interactivefiction]] or most text adventures
- "who is the you in a second person point of view story? There are actually a few different possibilities:

    The narrator is addressing the reader

    The narrator is addressing themselves

    The narrator is addressing another character"

## Pros

-   In a second person narrative, the writer casts the reader as the main character. **The reader is placed at the very centre of the story**, which makes for an intense and immersive reader experience.
    

-   This POV can also be used **to reinforce the key themes and ideas of the story**. Perhaps the narrator wants to distance themselves from their own narrative because the topic is difficult to think or talk about. Or perhaps self-talk is central to your narrator's identity.
    

-   **Second person POV is an exciting challenge for a writer**. And an original and intriguing format for a reader. To avoid putting too much pressure on either party, short stories written in the second person provide a good introduction to this mode of storytelling.

## Cons

-   **It’s not something writers or readers are used to**. It’s rare to come across fiction written in the second person. And – honestly – writers don’t tend to consider it as one of the narrative formats available to them.
    

-   **Readers don’t always like it**. They may feel uncomfortable or alienated from events when being told by a narrator that they have acted or spoken in ways that feel far removed from their own real life experience.
    

-   Because readers don’t tend to like second person point of view narratives, **it’s much harder to convince an agent or publisher** that your story has commercial potential.
    

-   A reader will inevitably question this form of storytelling. So a writer has to convince the reader that the second person point of view is necessary to the narrative. **Very few stories really require it** – so writers simply choose other points of view.
