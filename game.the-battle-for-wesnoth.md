## Description

### WML

Wesnoth Markup Language (WML) is used to code almost everything in Wesnoth, including scenarios, units, savefiles, and the user interface layout. WML files are simple, human-readable text files, usually with the .cfg extension, with similarities to INI files and XML. A major feature in WML are macros, which are alike those found in the C language and similarily are handled by a preprocessor.
