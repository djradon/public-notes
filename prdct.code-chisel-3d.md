## Features

- Code that is evaluated in CodeChisel3D uses the [lively.vm module](https://github.com/LivelyKernel/lively.vm) of the [Lively Web construction kit](https://lively-next.org). It enables to control the execution of JavaScript code much more than a simple eval usage. Code can be instrumented, and state injected and extracted.
