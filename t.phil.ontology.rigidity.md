## Modal Logic Rigidity

- "Ordinarily, the word is used to describe a
term, and means that the term denotes the same individual in all possible worlds"
- Rigidity is a second-order property: it is something that is predicated of properties


## "Guarino's Rigidity"

- "These definitions bear comment because they differ from the standard use of the
word ‘rigid’ in the modal logic literature. 

### Rigidity

- Members of a rigid class/instances of rigid type necessarily belong to this class in all possible worlds unless they cease to exist. 
  - example: an atom
    - @chatgpt While an atom can transmute into another element, it does not cease to be an atom. 

### Non-rigidity

- (At least) some instances of a non-rigid class do not have to belong to that class in all possible contexts.
  - example: a mass of 4kg (artifacts might "pass through" the class, but a certain number of atoms of gold will always be 4kg)

#### anti-rigidity

- If every individual that instantiate a given type in a particular time can cease to do so and still exists, then we call that type ANTI-RIGID
- no instance of the property has the property necessarily
  - example: puppy


## Use in ontologies

- "The notion of rigidity is brought to bear on the task of building ontologies by the constraint that an anti-rigid property can’t subsume a rigid one"
