## Features

- "Although re-frame leverages React (via Reagent), it only needs React to be the V in MVC, and no more. re-frame takes a different road to the currently-pervasive idea that Views should be causal (colocated queries, ComponentDidMount, hooks, etc). In re-frame, events are causal, and views are purely reactive."
