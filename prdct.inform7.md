        - Inform keeps track of the time of day automatically: play ordinarily begins at 9 AM and each turn takes one minute. In some works of interactive fiction, time of day is crucial: in others, it is irrelevant or even, by a sort of tacit convention, non-existent. So Inform does nothing to act upon the time, or to reveal it to the player, without instruction. Nevertheless it is there.

## Pros

- "creates an illusion of letting an English major write a script for an adventure game that reads like English that someone can play in what looks like a subset of English. It does it all with a very primitive production rules engine that relies heavily on defaults. Practical logic requires attention to rules and "schemes" (X macros, configuration settings on the rules engine.) I wrote an adventure game with a few rooms and objects in Drools and dreamt of making something like "Inform 7 for business rules"."
