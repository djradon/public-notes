## Principles


1. Data is a key asset of any person, organization, and society.
2. Data is self-describing and does not rely on an application for interpretation and meaning.
3. Data is expressed in open, non-proprietary formats.
4. Access to and security of the data is a responsibility of the enterprise data layer or the personal data vault, and not managed by applications.
5. Applications are allowed to visit the data, perform their magic and express the results of their process back into the data layer.
