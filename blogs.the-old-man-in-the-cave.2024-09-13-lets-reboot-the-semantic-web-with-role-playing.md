## Learning In Public

Welcome to my developer journal where, in my crusade to reboot the Semantic Web, I'll be mapping out the technical landscape of [[computer-assisted role-play|t.role-playing.computer-assisted]] and documenting the problems and solutions I run into – all out in the open.

I hope it'll be motivational and help improve my writing. And ideally someone will find it helpful or interesting to boot. 

## Spoiler Alert

In the eponymous Twilight Zone episode from 1959, the old man in the cave is secretly a computer that keeps the local townsfolk alive by giving them the information they need (through an intermediary, their leader Goldsmith) to survive in a radioactive, post-apocalyptic world. They end up destroying the computer in the name of freedom, and then everyone except Goldsmith dies of radiation poisoning. 

It's a story about secular faith and a nice example of the [[t.story-telling.tropes.benevolent-ai]] trope.

## Making the Semantic Web Usable

The vision of the Semantic Web is simple: distributed, interoperable, and well-defined data.

The threads of the Semantic Web are [[prdct.rdf]] statements composed of a subject, a predicate, and an object. The form is beautiful in its simplicity.

But of course, the devil is in the details. I guess we should've expected it to take a while to iron the kinks out of something as ambitious as a universal data language. Still, it's been almost 25 years!

I want to heed [[Manu Sporny|user.manu-sporny]]'s [[call-to-arms|ar.json-ld-and-why-i-hate-the-semantic-web]]: "If you want to make the Semantic Web a reality, stop making the case for it and spend your time doing something more useful, like actually making machines smarter or helping people publish data in a way that’s useful to them." Turns out, making machines smarter was the easy part!

With the current state of the art, publishing data is still hard. In a word, the biggest issue for wider SW adoption is **usability**. 

I've got an idea for how to make data publishing free and easy for everyone. 

We will also need to address some big issues around expressivity: [[temporality|t.cs.data.temporality]], [[provenance|t.km.meta-knowledge.provenance]], [[n-ary relationships|t.cs.semantic-web.n-ary-relationships]], hypotheticals, [[probabilities|t.cs.data.probability-claims]], and [[multi-level theory|t.km.ontology.multi-level-theory]].

Don't even get me started on the state of [[prdct.RDF-star]].

There are also plenty of outstanding issues around SW infrastructure and best practices that've had me searching for solutions and dreaming up my own. I've got a glimmer of a solution to the [[httpRange-14 issue|vs.resources-that-refer-vs-resources-that-are#possible-solutions]]

In the trenches of academia, industry, and the World Wide Web Consortium, the Semantic Web can really get bogged down. But hopefully we can forge a path forward. I'd bet the old man in the publishing cave can help us out some.

In any case, I'm looking to make connections that could lead to collaboration. If our interests overlap, please reach out!


## Likely Topics

At the moment, I'm especially interested in role-playing *data modeling* and how to represent things like characters, stories, and evolving worlds. To that end, I'll be writing about [[applied ontology|t.km.ontology.applied]], [[linked data|t.cs.data.linked]], [[semantic methodologies|c.methodology.semantic-web]], and [[geographic information systems|t.cs.gis]]; reviewing existing efforts, and formulating some upper-level and meta-conceptualizations.

I'm also interested in and wary of AI (better termed [[synthetic intelligence|t.cs.synthetic-intelligence]]) and how it can help people role-play and create [[interactive drama|t.drama.interactive]]. Things like [[t.cs.ai.retrieval-augmented-generation.graphrag]] and [[agentic systems|t.cs.agents]] are highly relevant.

I will touch on other topics in [[data science|t.cs.data.science]] and [[software development|t.cs.sd]] including [[software architecture|t.cs.sd.architecture]] and [[visualization|t.cs.data.visualization]]. 

## Next Steps

If you might be interested in the less-technical aspects of my crusade, or [[story-telling|t.story-telling]] and the [[digital humanities|t.humanities.digital]] in general, check out my other blog, [Carpe Noctem]().

Now, let's go pull the old man out of his cave and have a good look.
