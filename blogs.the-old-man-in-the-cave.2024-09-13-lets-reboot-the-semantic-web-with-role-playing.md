## Learning In Public

Welcome to my developer journal where, in my crusade to vitalize the Semantic Web, I'll be mapping out the landscape of [[computer-assisted role-play|t.role-playing.computer-assisted]] and documenting the problems I run into – all out in the open.

It should be motivational and help improve my writing. And ideally someone will find it helpful or interesting to boot. 

## Vitalizing the Semantic Web

But most importantly, I'm starting this thing because I want to heed [[Manu Sporny|user.manu-sporny]]'s [[call-to-arms|ar.json-ld-and-why-i-hate-the-semantic-web]]: "If you want to make the Semantic Web a reality, stop making the case for it and spend your time doing something more useful, like actually making machines smarter or helping people publish data in a way that’s useful to them." 

Who knows, maybe [[role-playing|t.role-playing]] will be the [[t.cs.semantic-web]]'s killer app.

In any case, I'm looking to make connections that could lead to collaboration. If our interests overlap, please reach out!


## Spoiler Alert

In the eponymous Twilight Zone episode from 1959, the Old Man is secretly a computer that keeps the local townsfolk alive by giving them the information they need (through an intermediary, their leader Goldsmith) to survive in a radioactive, post-apocalyptic world. They end up destroying the computer in the name of freedom, and then everyone except Goldsmith dies of radiation poisoning. 

It's a story about secular faith and a nice example of the [[t.story-telling.tropes.benevolent-ai]] trope.

## Likely Topics

Lately, I've been looking at technology through the lense of [[computer-assisted role-playing (CARP)|t.role-playing.computer-assisted]]. At the moment, I'm especially interested in role-playing *data* and how to represent things like characters, stories, and evolving worlds. To that end, I'll be writing about [[applied ontology|t.km.ontology.applied]], the [[t.cs.semantic-web]], [[data temporality|t.cs.data.temporality]], and [[geographic information systems|t.cs.gis]].

I'm also interested in and wary of AI (better termed [[synthetic intelligence|t.cs.synthetic-intelligence]]) and how it can help people role-play and create [[interactive drama|t.drama.interactive]]. Things like [[t.cs.ai.retrieval-augmented-generation.graphrag]] and [[agentic systems|t.cs.agents]] are highly relevant.

I will touch on other topics in [[data science|t.cs.data.science]] and [[software development|t.cs.sd]] including [[software architecture|t.cs.sd.architecture]] and [[visualization|t.cs.data.visualization]]. 

If you might be interested in the less-technical aspects of my crusade, or [[story-telling|t.story-telling]] and the [[t.humanities.digital]] in general, check out my other blog, [Carpe Noctem]().

## Next Steps

Let's go pull the Semantic Web out of its cave and have a good look!
