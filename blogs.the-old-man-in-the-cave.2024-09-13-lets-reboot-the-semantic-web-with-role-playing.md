## Learning In Public

Welcome to my developer journal. 

I'm on a mission to help people build, deconstruct, remix, and engage with the [[multiverse|t.multiverse]] through something like [[computer-assisted role-play (CARP)|t.roleplaying.computer-assisted]], [[the metaverse|t.cs.metaverse]] [[t.storytelling.collaborative]]. 

The dream is accessible alternate realities that draw on our collective cultural history and are worthy of our engagement. I don't love the word, but you could think of it as [[t.cs.metaverse]] Anyone can play, anyone can create, and the experience is meaningful and worthwhile.

It'll be made possible by a corresponding, new-ish artform. Call it digital adventure production, role-playing experience curation, or [[the electric magic store|idea.electric-magic-store]]. It weaves together aspects of film, video games, immersive theatre, and role-playing gaming. It will be the spiritual successor of today's [[virtual tabletops|t.roleplaying.virtual-tabletop]].

In additional to imagination, artistry, and production skills, this dream require distributed, interoperable, and well-defined data. Which just happens to be the vision of the [[t.cs.semantic-web]].

So in addition to my main mission to make this dream a reality, I have a technical side-quest to reboot the Semantic Web. 

## Spoiler Alert: It's a Machine

In the eponymous Twilight Zone episode from 1959, the old man in the cave is secretly a computer that keeps the local townsfolk alive by giving them the information they need (through an intermediary, their leader Goldsmith) to survive in a radioactive, post-apocalyptic world. They end up destroying the computer in the name of freedom, and then everyone except Goldsmith dies of radiation poisoning. 

It's a story about secular faith and a nice example of the [[t.storytelling.tropes.benevolent-ai]] trope.

In the context of this developer journal, the Old Man is a metaphor for synthetic intelligence and how we can use digital tools and digitized information to help humanity.

## Making the Semantic Web Usable

The vision of the Semantic Web is simple: distributed, interoperable, and well-defined data.

The threads of the Semantic Web are [[prdct.rdf]] statements composed of a subject, a predicate, and an object. The form is beautiful in its simplicity. For example:

```turtle
:the-old-man-in-the-cave :helped :goldsmith .
:goldsmith :helped :the-townsfolk .
```

But of course, the devil is in the details.

I want to heed [[Manu Sporny|user.manu-sporny]]'s 2014 [[call-to-arms|ar.json-ld-and-why-i-hate-the-semantic-web]]: "If you want to make the Semantic Web a reality, stop making the case for it and spend your time doing something more useful, like actually making machines smarter or helping people publish data in a way thatâ€™s useful to them." 

Turns out that making machines smarter was the easy part!

With the current state of the art, publishing **any** semantic data is still hard, let alone useful data. In a word, the most important theme for wider SW adoption is **usability**. 

I've got some ideas for how to make data publishing free and easy for everyone. So that should help usability.

To make published data useful, we'll need to address some long-simmering issues around RDF expressivity: [[temporality|t.cs.data.temporality]], [[provenance|t.km.meta-knowledge.provenance]], hypotheticals, [[probabilities|t.cs.data.probability-claims]], [[n-ary relationships|t.cs.semantic-web.n-ary-relationships]], and [[multi-level theory|t.km.ontology.multi-level-theory]].

Don't even get me started on the state of [[prdct.RDF-star]].

There are also plenty of gaps around SW infrastructure and best practices that have had me searching for solutions and dreaming up my own. I've got a glimmer of a solution to the [[httpRange-14 issue|vs.resources-that-refer-vs-resources-that-are#possible-solutions]], for example. Stay tuned next week!

In the trenches of academia, industry, and the World Wide Web Consortium, the Semantic Web has gotten bogged down. 

I guess we should've expected it to take a while to iron the kinks out of something as ambitious as a universal data language. Still, it's been almost 25 years!

The time is right to forge a path forward. And I'd bet the old man in the cave can help us out.

## Likely Topics

At the moment, I'm especially interested in role-playing *data modeling* and how to represent things like characters, stories, and evolving worlds. To that end, I'll be writing about [[applied ontology|t.km.ontology.applied]], [[Semantic Web methodologies|c.methodology.semantic-web]], and [[geographic information systems|t.cs.gis]]

In the near term, I'm hoping to develop some upper-level and meta-conceptualizations, i.e., ontologies, with related best practices, and weave together some publishing infrastructure.

I'm also interested in and wary of AI (better termed [[synthetic intelligence|t.cs.synthetic-intelligence]]) and how it can help people role-play and create [[interactive drama|t.drama.interactive]]. Things like [[t.cs.ai.retrieval-augmented-generation.graphrag]] and [[agentic systems|t.cs.agents]] are highly relevant.

I intend to touch on related topics in [[data science|t.cs.data.science]] and [[software development|t.cs.sd]] including [[software architecture|t.cs.sd.architecture]], [[visualization|t.cs.data.visualization]] and [[product design|t.pdm.design]]. 

## Next Steps

If you might be interested in the less-technical aspects of my mission, or [[story-telling|t.storytelling]] and the [[digital humanities|t.humanities.digital]] in general, check out my other blog, [Carpe Noctem]().

In any case, I'm looking to make connections that could lead to collaboration. If our interests overlap, please reach out!

Now, let's go pull the old man out of his cave and have a good look.
