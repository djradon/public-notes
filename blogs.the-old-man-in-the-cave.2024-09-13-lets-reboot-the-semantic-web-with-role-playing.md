## Learning In Public

Welcome to my developer journal where, in my crusade to vitalize the Semantic Web, I'll be mapping out the technical landscape of [[computer-assisted role-play|t.role-playing.computer-assisted]] and documenting the problems and solutions I run into – all out in the open.

I hope it'll be motivational and help improve my writing and thinking. And ideally someone will find it helpful or interesting to boot. 

## Spoiler Alert

In the eponymous Twilight Zone episode from 1959, the old man in the cave is secretly a computer that keeps the local townsfolk alive by giving them the information they need (through an intermediary, their leader Goldsmith) to survive in a radioactive, post-apocalyptic world. They end up destroying the computer in the name of freedom, and then everyone except Goldsmith dies of radiation poisoning. 

It's a story about secular faith and a nice example of the [[t.story-telling.tropes.benevolent-ai]] trope.

## Vitalizing the Semantic Web

I want to heed [[Manu Sporny|user.manu-sporny]]'s [[call-to-arms|ar.json-ld-and-why-i-hate-the-semantic-web]]: "If you want to make the Semantic Web a reality, stop making the case for it and spend your time doing something more useful, like actually making machines smarter or helping people publish data in a way that’s useful to them." 

Who knows, maybe [[role-playing|t.role-playing]] will be the [[t.cs.semantic-web]]'s killer app.

But we will need to address some big issues around the Semantic Web's lingua franca, [[prdct.rdf]]: [[temporality|t.cs.data.temporality]], [[provenance|t.km.meta-knowledge.provenance]], [[expressive power|t.cs.semantic-web.n-ary-relationships]], hypotheticals, [[probabilities|t.cs.data.probability-claims]], [[multi-level theory|t.km.ontology.multi-level-theory]] and most importantly, usability. In the semantic trenches of academia, industry, and the [[World Wide Web Consortium|t.cs.web.w3c]], things are really as complicated as they sound. But hopefully they don't have to be! I'd bet the old man in the cave can help us out some.

In any case, I'm looking to make connections that could lead to collaboration. If our interests overlap, please reach out!


## Likely Topics

At the moment, I'm especially interested in role-playing *data* and how to represent things like characters, stories, and evolving worlds. To that end, I'll be writing about [[applied ontology|t.km.ontology.applied]], [[linked data|t.cs.data.linked]], [[semantic methodologies|c.methodology.semantic-web]], and [[geographic information systems|t.cs.gis]]; reviewing existing efforts, and formulating some upper-level and meta-conceptualizations.

I'm also interested in and wary of AI (better termed [[synthetic intelligence|t.cs.synthetic-intelligence]]) and how it can help people role-play and create [[interactive drama|t.drama.interactive]]. Things like [[t.cs.ai.retrieval-augmented-generation.graphrag]] and [[agentic systems|t.cs.agents]] are highly relevant.

I will touch on other topics in [[data science|t.cs.data.science]] and [[software development|t.cs.sd]] including [[software architecture|t.cs.sd.architecture]] and [[visualization|t.cs.data.visualization]]. 

## Next Steps

If you might be interested in the less-technical aspects of my crusade, or [[story-telling|t.story-telling]] and the [[digital humanities|t.humanities.digital]] in general, check out my other blog, [Carpe Noctem]().

Now, let's go pull the old man out of his cave and have a good look.
