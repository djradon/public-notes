## Representation and manipulation of time

The specific affordances of time-based media and live interaction with code has led to a number of novel developments and uses in programming language design. Through mutual embedding of imperative and declarative subsystems, the programming language [SuperCollider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperCollider "SuperCollider")<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_coding#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> permitted to build a library that allows incomplete and provisional specifications which can be rewritten at runtime.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_coding#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup>

The [ChucK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChucK "ChucK") language introduced an approach to "strongly timed" programming in 2002, embedding precision timing into control flow through a concise syntax.

"Temporal recursion" was a term initially coined in relation to the [Impromptu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impromptu_(programming_environment) "Impromptu (programming environment)") programming environment. Technical elements within a programming environment continue to locate compressors and recursion solutions, but timing had been a major issue. While the general form of a temporal recursion, being any asynchronous function recursion through time, is available to any event driven system, Impromptu has placed a special emphasis on this particular design pattern,<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_coding#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> making it the centre piece of the concurrency architecture on that platform. Temporal recursion had repeatedly been used in [SuperCollider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperCollider "SuperCollider") and has since been implemented in the [Fluxus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluxus_(programming_environment) "Fluxus (programming environment)") environment.

Another functional approach to the representation of time is shown in the [Tidal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_(livecoding) "Tidal (livecoding)") pattern [DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language "Domain-specific language"),<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_coding#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> which represents patterns as combinators operating over functions of time, similar to techniques in [functional reactive programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming "Functional reactive programming").<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_coding#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup>
