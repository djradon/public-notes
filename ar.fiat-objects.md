## Highlights

- crisp vs scruffy (fuzzy, hazy, indeterminate)
- fiat vs bona fide


## Selections

- A typology of entities  Thetime starting point for our categorial scheme is the  concept of extended entity. Two sorts of extended entity  are distinguished initially: objects, which are extended  in space; and processes, which are extended in time
- Of course, you and I are in a sense extended not only in space but also in time. But we do not have temporal parts in the sense in which lives and headaches and orbits have temporal parts. This, at least, will be the assumption in what follows – sometimes called the [[t.phil.assumption-of three-dimensionalism]]
  - [[c.thought]] drawing a distinction between me and my life is unintuitive.

- genuine/"bona fide" boundaries vs fiat boundaries : "exists/does not exist independently of human cognitive acts"
- "Examples of genuine inner temporal boundaries – corresponding to some physical discontinuity or intrinsic qualitative differentiation – might be: the point in the flight of the projectile at which it reaches its maximum altitude and begins its descent to earth, the point in the process of cooling of the liquid at which it first begins to solidify, the point in the splitting of an amoeba when one substance suddenly becomes two. Examples of inner boundaries of the second sort might be: the boundary between the fourth and fifth minute of the race, John’s reaching the age of three, the scheduled time for the beginning of the meeting.

  - (bf = bona fide, f = fiat, o = object, p = process, sb = spatial boundary, tb = temporal boundary).
- Geographic features, along with other features of reality that we encounter at human and non-human scales, have parts at both macro and micro levels of granularity, and when we pay careful atten- tion to the latter then the idea that there are abrupt physical discontinuities begins itself to seem question- able (as though what is a discontinuity were itself a fiat matter).
