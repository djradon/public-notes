## Issues



## Trivia

- the movie theater downtown, whose ticket booth is used by Michael and Maureen as their hiding place, is showing Terry Gilliam's Time Bandits.

## Quotes

- "Now think of time as an infinite series of boxcars all linked together, like this. Now each boxcar represents one minutes, and people like yourselves move from boxcar to boxcar as time moves forward. 

### Closing Narration

"Time, a handy fiction to explain why everything doesn't happen all at once. Or maybe we're the fiction, moving minute by minute...through the Twilight Zone. "
