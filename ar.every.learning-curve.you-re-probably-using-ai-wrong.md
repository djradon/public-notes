## Highlights

- I stopped thinking of LLMs as tools that would write for me. Instead, I started using them to help me with a part of writing I don’t enjoy: being stuck.
- I like the process of choosing the words I commit to posterity on the internet. I don’t just like it, I cherish it.
- Examine your lifestyle as an adult, because it is often a tangible manifestation of your internal belief system. If you’re always learning new skills, you value personal growth; if a daily workout feels essential to you, you stand for health; if you prioritize dinners at home, you appreciate a strong family unit. Think about where you spend your resources—time, energy, and money—and you’ll have your answer.
