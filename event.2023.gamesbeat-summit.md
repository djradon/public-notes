## the future of mobile gaming

- leaders are deeply entrenched; [[acquisition|t.cs.game.user-acquisition]] costs rising; innovation is pending/needed to unseat leaders
- ops is continuous; 

## transforming gaming experiences with [[t.cs.ai]]

- [[c.Host]] @joost-van-dreunen
- [[c.Panelist]] @john-riccitiello
  - built an inference engine ([[prdct.unity.barracuda]]) inside the runtime 
  - web3 is not going to be a big impact; vr/xr only by end of decade
  - creation of content (ways we make games)
  - games themselves i.e., engagement
  - "no one produces code or art in one shot with [[prdct.github.copilot]]"; takes a lot of iteration
    - you'll be more productive with the tools
    - how are fully immersive, customized experiences going to happen?
      - "going to take a lot of experimentation, but the world is going to feel alive" - most creators of open-world-style games have been dreaming about this! "I can bring life into these characters"
      - going to "lift our world", more engagement = more revenue, 
      - no more stretching to use "emergent" and "ai" metaphors, it's going to happen
  - As a player, how do you choose? role of intellectual property? 
  - Game Developers can do everything; open-source in this arena outperforms close platforms; "big mega-caps don't have all the advantages they usually have"; big opportunity for the little gals


## Ready Player All: Launching Games at the Forefront of Culture

- [[c.Panelist]] @mike-quigley @assaf-sagy @rema-vasan
- privacy considerations make [[t.cs.game.user-acquisition]] into marketers
- @rema-vasan
  - it's discovering through intersectionality (film creator, fashion designer, etc all have a role) beyond core gaming community
  - "culture is an esoteric word" but analytics on hashtags
- @mike-quigley NPS / Sentiment matters/moves-in-lockstep around live event or a new features; views matter, but need to give users permission to engage with their content! ("they're going to do it anyway, so you might as well embrace it")
- Why is tiktok uniquely good? Flywheel! Brand handle. [[game.paridot]]
- "Funnel effect" 1B views -> actually driving revenue streams
- @mike-quigley "building original IP is hard, and getting harder";  
  - gives assets to creators; authenticity means giving up control; microcommunities sustain themselves
- awareness -> engagment -> performance
- "go beyond the gameplay"  - what are the other communities; lean into the power of the creators and communities; experiment


## From Niche to Mainstream: The Path to Mass Adoption of Blockchain in Gaming

- [[c.Panelist]] @mark-otero

- @paul-bettner
  - making [[game.wildcard]]
  - what happens when there's a good web3 game?
  - AI biggest effect is (game-creation) tools; because the tools are text-oriented, "not so impactful"
- @canaan-linder
  - new platform can still bring in web2 players
  - "bring your identity to the game"; bringing a history of you enables the NPCs
- @mark-otero
  - we all have 24 hours in a day; we look to self-optimize our day; we need to create something so good, it changes your rhythm of life; don't misplace the focus; "lowest friction possible"
  - time-value paradox (a function to zero)
    - person worth $1000/hr doesn't want to see the emerald sword he worked for on sale for $.25. "The race to zero";
  - character classes:
    - started with DM and players; now, there's the speculator
      - need to design a game that appeals to all three, but nobody can wreck it for anybody else
- @angela-dalton
  - won't we want to express our social capital with ownership?
- @mark-otero
  - "every game is a miracle that is a string of unknown tragedies"
  - needed a tool to see things as they are, so created "philosophy of fun"
    - "What is the aspiration?"
    - spirit of aspirations and dreams; a way to actualize their fantasies, feel powerful.
    - web3 aspiration: wealth! (it's not traditional entertainment)
  - AI is seemingly intelligent; has density clusters (intelligence) but not the wisdom 
    - wisdom is required to make the strategic choices
- @canaan-linder
  - a streamer can sign your sword. Transparency. Everybody indexing your data. 
  - it's okay not to know what the future holds

## Power to the People

- [[c.Panelist]] @emmanuel-de-amistre @jordan-weisman
- @jordan-weisman ceo of [[org.endless-adventures]]
  - "ai-cautious game creator"; it's about the human artform; it's about how do we empower without overcoming; genies don't go back into bottles
  - "I want more people to be gamedevs"
  - loves narrative games
    - "blank sheet of paper" is to intimidating; 
    - doesn't believe yet that writers/creators can express enough of the specifics/intent/emotion through the portal of LLM tools
  - videogames have been exclusionary; AI will drive other voices and innovation
  - start by making it accessible to "no-code"; AI has revolutionized accessibility
- @emmanuel-de-amistre
  - first product: lidar + photogrammatry to create 3d objects;
  - transitioned into facilitating creation via prompt, including [[prdct.midjourney]];
    - "easy to create game objects for anybody"
    - a private midjourney
  - 3d is 6 months behind 2d (text to 3d or 2d to 3d)
  - driven by the players
  - artists / art directors are the biggest fans of the product
