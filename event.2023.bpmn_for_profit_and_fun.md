- Process, before you start coding, and iterate

- use Event Storming
- try "tab per process"

## Pitfalls

- no begin or end event
- activities do not have action verbs
  - i.e., commands
- activities named after technical aspects
- flows start to have too many elements
  - add subprocess if necessary
  - break diagrams out into blackbox, just showing interface points

## Takeaways

- Focus on what matters
- Capture the dependencies between domains/products
- add as part of iterative development lifecycle
