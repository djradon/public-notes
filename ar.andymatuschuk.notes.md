## [[p.hasHighlight]]

### [[t.km.note-taking]]

- [People who write extensively about note-writing rarely have a serious context of use](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zUMFE66dxeweppDvgbNAb5hukXzXQu8ErVNv)
  - my serious contexts are:
    -  "keeping track of different solutions for my ITSM/tech adopter" role at Bombora 
    -  "keeping track of the people I manage, and our work as a team
    - GraphDown
  - I don't write extensively

### [[t.pdm]]

- [Premature scaling can stunt system iteration](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z2kr7QrJczqYyfwLFcv1FLEUMdVTsgfYSdFXA)
  - certainly true for my dendron-workspace... it's already ossifying

## Productivity

- [The high-order bit for my productivity is whether I complete a deeply-focused morning creative block](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zR9LxW1N893EXwQ3Fma1Gz4xPa1tF2Zd6zZ)

## Inbox

- [Inboxes only work if you trust how theyâ€™re drained](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z5tiFxnNKMZCnc8G9R1N51L5hknyRGmyCQx18)
- [Triage strategies for maintaining inboxes (e.g. Inbox Zero) are often too brittle](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z8aZybuJJopS5fL7TnPou2JcmCsBUJeqirbBh)
