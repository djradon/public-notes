## Definitions

a logical theory accounting for the intended meaning of a formal vocabulary, i.e. its ontological commitment to a particular conceptualization of the world. The intended models of a logical language using such a vocabulary are constrained by its ontological commitment. An ontology indirectly reflects this commitment (and the underlying conceptualization) by approximating these intended models.

## Thoughts

- "facts assumed to always be true by a community" is tricky
  - a-box assertions about a fictional setting could qualify as an ontology. 


### "Schools"

  - Philosophy School
  - Vocabulary and Taxonomy School
      - These taxonomies often model a domain as hierarchical structures without defining what a link in the hierarchy actually means. As a result, they often mix sub-component and sub-class hierarchies.
  - Relational School
  - Object-Oriented School
  - Standards School
  - Linked Data School
  - NLP/LLM School
  - Data-Centric School
