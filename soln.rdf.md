- [[p.instanceOf]] [[c.Specification]]

## to do

- [<] #p4 [[p.summarized]] [RDF datasets](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-datasets/)
  - the concept of the "unnamed default graph"/master-graph is interesting; 
    - seems like dendron.yml is the master graph. expressed as yaml
  - [[p.hasRelatedResource]] [The unnamed/default graph should have a standard name](https://github.com/w3c/sparql-12/issues/43)

## [[p.hasIssue]]

- contrary to [some claims](https://www.ontotext.com/knowledgehub/fundamentals/what-is-rdf/), RDF and OWL are not fluent, at least compared to GraphDown
- calls verbs properties / predicates
- confuses properties and predicates
- can't easily express intransitive relations (properties)
- 

## can be expressed as 

- [[soln.rdf.aREF]]
- [[soln.rdf.turtle]]
 
## hasRelatedResource

- https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-datasets/
  - [[p.begsQuestion]] [<] What is [[the difference betwee the union of the graphs and their merge|tasks.rdf.the-difference-betwee-the-union-of-the-graphs-and-their-merge]]? Is the distinction meaningful for [[soln.Dendron]]?
