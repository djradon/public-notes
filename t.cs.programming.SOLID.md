  - The Single-responsibility principle: "There should never be more than one reason for a class to change."[5] In other words, every class should have only one responsibility.[6]
  - The Openâ€“closed principle: "Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."[7]
  - The Liskov substitution principle: "Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it."[8] See also design by contract.[8]
  - The Interface segregation principle: "Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface."[9][4]
  - The Dependency inversion principle: "Depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions."[10][4]
