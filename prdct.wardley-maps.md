### [[On Being Lost|https://medium.com/wardleymaps/on-being-lost-2ef5f05eb1ec]]

Sun Tzu’s five factors are:

**Purpose** is your moral imperative, it is the scope of what you are doing and why you are doing it. It is the reason why others follow you.

**Landscape** is a description of the environment that you’re competing in. It includes the position of troops, the features of the landscape and any obstacles in your way.

**Climate** describes the forces that act upon the environment. It is the patterns of the seasons and the rules of the game. These impact the landscape and you don’t get to choose them but you can discover them. It includes your competitors actions.

**Doctrine** is the training of your forces, the standard ways of operating and the techniques that you almost always apply. These are the universal principles, the set of beliefs that appear to work regardless of the landscape that is faced.

**Leadership** is about the strategy that you choose considering your purpose, the landscape, the climate and your capabilities. It is to “the battle at hand”. It is context specific i.e. these techniques are known to depend upon the landscape and your purpose.
