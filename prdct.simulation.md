### Primitives

`simulation` models are composed out of building blocks called "primitives" In this model we're going to use three primitives:

-   A **Stock** to store the number of people in the world population. Generally, stocks store things like people, dollars, water, or anything else
-   A **Flow** to define the change in the population stock. Flows model the movement of material between stocks.
-   A **Variable** to define the net growth rate for the population. In this model, that will be a constant value, but it could also be a dynamic equation.
