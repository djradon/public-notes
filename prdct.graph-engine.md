    - "The most important building block provided by GE for distributed computation is declarative message passing. We can implement almost any distributed algorithm using the fine-grained event-driven message passing framework provided by GE."
    - "GE provides two methods for serving a service: REST APIs and GE protocols.

    REST APIs: They are standard, cross-platform, and easy-to-use. If we specify a RESTful service protocol named MyService, GE will automatically generate a REST service endpoint: http://example.com/MyService.

    GE Protocols: They are the most efficient way to call a service implemented in the computation layer."
    - "storage layer of GE is a key-value store."
