## Options

- Feature Branch Workflow: Each new feature, bug fix, or task gets its branch, which is merged into the main branch after review.
- GitFlow: A more structured approach with branches for features, releases, and hotfixes.
- Trunk-Based Development: Focuses on short-lived feature branches merged into the main branch frequently.
