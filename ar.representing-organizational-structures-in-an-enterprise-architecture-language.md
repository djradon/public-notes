## Abstract

Enterprise Architecture (EA) promotes the establishment of a holistic view of the structure and way of working of an organization. One of the aspects covered in EA is associated with the organization’s “active structure”, which concerns “who” undertakes organizational activities. Several approaches have been proposed in order to provide a means for representing enterprise architectures, among which the ArchiMate, an EA modeling language. In this paper, we present a semantic analysis of the fragment of the ArchiMate metamodel related with the representation of active structure. In addition, we present a proposal to extend the metamodel based on a well-founded ontology for the organizational domain. Our objective is to enrich the language with important capabilities to represent organizational structures using a principled ontology-based approach.
