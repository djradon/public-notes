## **Metaverse**:

An interconnected digital world where users can interact, socialize, and create. Often associated with [[VR|t.cs.virtual-reality]], [[AR|t.cs.augmented-reality]], and digital economies. Itâ€™s essentially **shared digital spaces**.


## Thoughts

- I do not like the term 'metaverse'! 
  - Besides the Facebook connotations and the [[user.neal-stephensen]]-esque geekiness of it, it's not a universe about the universe. It's just a set of alternate universes.  ^pdbekjzfr2l0
    - although some see it, and it was originally conceived as a monolithic alternate reality
- "Some envision the metaverse as an augmented reality or virtual reality experience, where users can immerse themselves in a computer-generated environment. Others envision the metaverse as a platform like Roblox or Unreal Engine, where users can Create and share their own virtual worlds. There are also those who see the metaverse as a blockcHain-Based system, where users can buy, sell, and trade virtual assets... [[t.rec.dungeons-and-dragons]] can be conSidered the first real metaverse." [^1]
