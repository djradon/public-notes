## Abstract

- The article identified 42 cognitive architectures for creating general artificial intelligence (AGI) and proposed a set of interrelated functional blocks that an agent approaching AGI in its capabilities  should possess. Since the re- quired set of blocks is not found in any of the existing architectures, the article proposes a new cognitive architecture for intelligent systems approaching AGI in their capabilities. As one of the key solutions within the framework of the archi- tecture, a universal method of knowledge representation is proposed, which al- lows combining various non-formalized, partially and fully formalized methods of knowledge representation in a single knowledge base, such as texts in natural languages, images, audio  and video recordings, graphs, algorithms, databases, neural networks, knowledge graphs, ontologies, frames, essence-property-rela- tion models, production systems, predicate calculus models, conceptual models, and others. To  combine and  structure various  fragments of  knowledge, archi- graph models are used, constructed as a development of annotated metagraphs. As components,  the cognitive  architecture being developed  includes machine consciousness, machine subconsciousness, blocks of interaction with the external environment, a goal management block, an emotional control system, a block of social interaction, a block of reflection, an ethics block and a worldview block, a learning block, a monitoring block, blocks of statement and solving problems, self-organization and meta learning block
