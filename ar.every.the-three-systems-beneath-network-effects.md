  - “Acquisition Effect”:: the ability for a product to tap into its network to acquire new customers
  - “Engagement Effect”:: a denser (or more diverse) network creates higher stickiness and/or new use cases
  - “Economic Effect”:: the ability for a networked product to accelerate its monetization, reduce its costs, and otherwise improve its business model, as its network grows
