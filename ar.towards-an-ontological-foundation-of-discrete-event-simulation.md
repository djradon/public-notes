## Abstract

This paper is an attempt to transfer some results in the meta-theory of conceptual modeling of software systems to discrete event simulation modeling. We present DESO, a foundational ontology for discrete event system modeling derived from the foundational ontology UFO. The main purpose of DESO is to provide a basis for evaluating discrete event simulation languages.
