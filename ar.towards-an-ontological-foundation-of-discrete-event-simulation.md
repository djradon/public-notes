## Abstract

This paper is an attempt to transfer some results in the meta-theory of conceptual modeling of software systems to discrete event simulation modeling. We present DESO, a foundational ontology for discrete event system modeling derived from the foundational ontology UFO. The main purpose of DESO is to provide a basis for evaluating discrete event simulation languages.

## Highlights

- using an ontologically well-founded modeling language seems to be even more relevant for simulation engineering than for software system engineering ^zfbe99hkh7b3
- DES is the most fundamental simulation paradigm ^f4xouwm2jcoa
- both UML and BPMN, with suitable modifications and enhancements based on their ontological analysis and im- provement, have a high potential as simulation modeling languages.
