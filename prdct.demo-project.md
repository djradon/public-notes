## Features

- the DeMO ontology constitutes a high-level simulation language supporting the paradigms of ‘state-oriented’, ‘event-oriented’, ‘activity-oriented’ and ‘process-oriented’ simulation
- We start by placing two equivalent (in modeling power) formalisms on the top � Generalized Stochastic Petri Nets and Generalized Semi-Markov Process models
- There are three main components of the formalisms in consideration:
  1. Underlying graphical representation;

  2. Probabilistic transitions; (these may be also considered as a part of 1)

  3. [[t.cs.simulation.time.stochastic-clock-structure]] that introduces time in the model and is used as an input
