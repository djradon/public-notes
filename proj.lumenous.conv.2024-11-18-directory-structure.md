## comingling of Lume files and content (dave)

lumenous-template is my Lume template that I want people to be able to re-use for repo/application documentation and static sites in general. I've broken the top-level directory structure down into "docs" (where the generated site files go) and "src/site" where the lume files and site source material goes. The thought is you could overlay that on an existing repo/project.

I'm struggling with directory layout and licensing for lumenous-template. Lume files and the layouts/scripts/includes etc that come with the site are MIT-licensed by Oscar Otero. So his LICENSE.md file could probably go in the src/site directory. But that's also where the custom site source material goes, so there's a mixing of his files and the user's content, which shouldn't have the same license.

## comingling of Lume files and content (chatgpt)

This is a common challenge when creating reusable templates that need to respect the licensing of upstream dependencies while allowing users to add their own content under a different license. Here's a possible structure and licensing strategy for your `lumenous-template`:

---

## **Proposed Directory Layout**
```plaintext
lumenous-template/
├── LICENSE.md                # Overall license for the template (e.g., MIT or your choice)
├── docs/                     # Generated site files (output from Lume)
│   └── [site output here]
├── src/                      # Source materials for the site
│   ├── LICENSE_Otero.md      # Oscar Otero's MIT license for his contributions
│   ├── site/                 # Lume files and custom site materials
│   │   ├── layouts/          # Layouts (MIT-licensed by Otero)
│   │   ├── includes/         # Includes (MIT-licensed by Otero)
│   │   ├── scripts/          # Scripts (MIT-licensed by Otero)
│   │   ├── content/          # Custom site content (user-licensed)
│   │   │   └── [user files]
│   │   └── lume.config.js    # Configuration (MIT-licensed)
│   ├── README.md             # Instructions for using the template
│   └── [other files]
├── README.md                 # High-level overview of lumenous-template
└── [additional files]
```

---

## **Licensing Strategy**

### **1. Overall Template License**
At the root of the repository, include a `LICENSE.md` file that applies to the entire `lumenous-template`. This license governs the use of your repository as a template, including its structure and any original files.

- **Example: MIT License**
  If your intent is for the template itself (not user-generated content) to be permissively reusable, use the MIT license.

---

### **2. Oscar Otero’s Contributions**
Since the layouts, scripts, and includes originate from Oscar Otero’s MIT-licensed Lume repository, you need to:
- Retain his license.
- Clearly indicate that his license applies only to specific parts of your template.

**Add a `LICENSE_Otero.md` in the `src/site` directory**, containing the original MIT license text and clarifying that it applies to the layouts, scripts, and includes.

---

### **3. User Content**
User-generated content (e.g., in `src/site/content`) should be clearly separated and **not governed by the MIT license of the template files**. You can:
- Add a README or comment in the `src/site/content` directory specifying that users are free to license their content however they wish.
- Provide a placeholder `LICENSE_CONTENT.md` file in the `src/site/content` directory as an example or guideline for licensing user content.

---

### **Example README for `src/site/content`**
```markdown
# Content Directory Licensing

This directory (`src/site/content`) is reserved for custom user-generated content. You are free to license the files in this directory under any license of your choosing.

For example:
- Use a permissive license (e.g., MIT or Apache 2.0) for open-source projects.
- Use a proprietary license for private projects.

**Important:** The MIT license provided in this repository does not apply to your content in this directory.
```

---

## **High-Level README**
In the root `README.md`, clearly explain the licensing strategy:

**Example:**
```markdown
# Lumenous Template

Lumenous is a reusable Lume template designed for generating documentation and static sites. This repository is structured to be overlaid on an existing project.

## Licensing

1. **Template Files:**
   - The files in `src/site/layouts`, `src/site/includes`, and `src/site/scripts` are licensed under the MIT license (see `src/site/LICENSE_Otero.md`).
   - These files are based on the work of Oscar Otero and the Lume project.

2. **Generated Site:**
   - The `docs` directory contains the output of the Lume build process. The license for this directory depends on the content you include in `src/site/content`.

3. **User Content:**
   - Files in `src/site/content` are **not governed by the MIT license**. You are free to license them under terms of your choosing.

4. **Overall Repository:**
   - The overall structure and tooling provided by this repository are licensed under the MIT license (see `LICENSE.md`).
```

---

### **Advantages of This Approach**
1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**:
   - Template files are clearly governed by Oscar Otero’s license.
   - User content is explicitly excluded from the MIT license.

2. **Encourages Flexibility**:
   - Users can license their content in any way they prefer.
   - Your template remains open and reusable.

3. **Transparency**:
   - By explicitly including separate licenses for Otero’s work and user content, you avoid legal ambiguity.

---

Let me know if you'd like further refinements or if there’s a specific aspect of this you’re unsure about!


## user content separation (dave)

An issue is that the layouts, includes, scripts, etc. directories have to contain user content as well. And you can't ( at least without modifying how Lume works) have a separate "content" directory, as that would show up under /content in the generated site. 

## user content separation (chatgpt)

Given that Lume's directory structure necessitates mixing template-provided files and user content in the same directories, you’ll need a clear and flexible approach to licensing and structuring your repository. Here’s how you can handle this situation:

---

### **Updated Directory Structure**
Keep everything in a single `src/site` directory but clarify the licensing through documentation and file organization:

```plaintext
lumenous-template/
├── LICENSE.md                # Overall license for the template
├── docs/                     # Generated site files (output from Lume)
│   └── [site output here]
├── src/                      # Source materials for the site
│   ├── LICENSE_Otero.md      # Oscar Otero's license for Lume template files
│   ├── site/                 # Source for Lume (includes user and template files)
│   │   ├── layouts/          # Layouts (template and user files mixed)
│   │   ├── includes/         # Includes (template and user files mixed)
│   │   ├── scripts/          # Scripts (template and user files mixed)
│   │   ├── assets/           # Static files like CSS, images, JS
│   │   ├── lume.config.js    # Configuration (MIT-licensed)
│   │   ├── README.md         # Licensing and usage notes for the site directory
│   │   ├── custom-content.md # Example of user-created content
│   │   └── [other files]
├── README.md                 # High-level overview of lumenous-template
└── [additional files]
```

---

### **Licensing Strategy**

#### 1. **Root-Level License**
The root `LICENSE.md` applies to the overall repository and any original files you’ve added (e.g., README files, helper scripts). Use a permissive license like MIT or a custom license if desired.

---

#### 2. **Oscar Otero’s License**
Place `LICENSE_Otero.md` in the `src/site` directory and clarify that it applies to the template files provided by Lume (e.g., layouts, includes, scripts). 

You might include a comment in those files, like this:
```html
<!-- Licensed under the MIT License. See src/site/LICENSE_Otero.md -->
```

---

#### 3. **User Content in Mixed Directories**
Since user content is mixed with template-provided files in `layouts`, `includes`, `scripts`, and similar directories, add a **README.md** in `src/site` to clarify licensing for mixed content:

**Example: `src/site/README.md`**
```markdown
# Lume Site Source Directory

## Licensing Notes

1. **Template Files**:
   - The default layouts, includes, and scripts provided in this directory are licensed under the MIT License (see `LICENSE_Otero.md`).

2. **User Content**:
   - Any files you add or modify in this directory (e.g., layouts, includes, or scripts) are considered user content.
   - You are free to license your content under terms of your choosing.
   - Template-provided files that you modify retain the MIT License unless you explicitly relicense them (subject to compatibility).

3. **Mixing Content**:
   - If your content and the provided template files are intermingled, be sure to clarify the license of your contributions in a comment or accompanying documentation.
```

---

### **Practical Licensing Scenarios**
1. **Template File Modified by User**:
   - If a user modifies a provided layout (e.g., `default.ejs`), their changes would still be governed by the original MIT license unless explicitly stated otherwise.

2. **User Adds New Content**:
   - A user adding a new file (e.g., `custom-header.ejs`) can license it independently of the MIT license governing the rest of the template.

3. **Generated Site**:
   - The user’s generated site (`docs/`) combines template and user content. The license of this directory is entirely under the user’s control since it depends on their usage.

---

### **Communication in the Root README**
In the root `README.md`, clarify how licensing works for users:

**Example:**
```markdown
# Lumenous Template

Lumenous is a reusable Lume template designed for generating documentation and static sites. This repository is structured to be overlaid on an existing project.

## Licensing

1. **Template Files**:
   - The `layouts`, `includes`, and `scripts` in `src/site` are licensed under the MIT license (see `src/site/LICENSE_Otero.md`).
   - You may freely modify these files, but they remain governed by the MIT license unless explicitly relicensed.

2. **User Content**:
   - Any files you add or modify in `src/site` that are not part of the original template (e.g., custom content, new layouts) are considered your work.
   - You may license your content under terms of your choosing.

3. **Generated Site**:
   - The files in the `docs/` directory are generated from the template and your content. The license for the output is entirely up to you as the user of this template.
```

---

### **Benefits of This Approach**
1. **Flexibility**:
   - Users can mix their content with template files without licensing confusion.
   - Template files remain under the original MIT license, while user-created content is separately licensed.

2. **Transparency**:
   - Clear documentation in both the root and `src/site` directories helps users understand licensing boundaries.

3. **Low Friction**:
   - No changes to Lume’s directory behavior are needed, and users can work directly in `src/site` without worrying about conflicts.

---

Let me know if this structure resolves your concerns or if you’d like further refinements!


## _config.ts as an example (dave)

Let's take _config.ts as an example. It's probably not Oscar's intention that people who modify that file for their own sites have to keep the file MIT-licensed. 

## _config.ts as an example (chatgpt)

You're absolutely correct—it's unlikely that Oscar Otero (or any creator of reusable templates/tools) intends for users to be bound by the original MIT license when they modify configuration files, such as `_config.ts`, to suit their specific projects. To address this, the licensing approach can explicitly exclude user-modified configuration files from being subject to the MIT license of the template.

Here’s a refined solution for licensing and communicating this clearly:

---

## **Clarifying Licensing for Customization**

### **1. Configuration Files as Templates**
Treat files like `_config.ts` as **template files** that are **intended for user modification**. These files serve as starting points and are expected to be changed by users for their specific needs.

### **2. Modify the License Notice**
Include a specific note in the root-level `LICENSE.md` or in a README about configuration files:

**Example: Root-Level `LICENSE.md`**
```markdown
## Special Licensing Note for Configuration Files

This repository includes configuration files (e.g., `_config.ts`) intended as templates for users to customize. While these files are initially licensed under the MIT license, modifications made to them for specific projects are the sole responsibility of the user, and the user is free to license their modified versions under terms of their choosing.
```

This makes it explicit that users are free to relicense modified configuration files.

---

### **3. Add Comments to Configuration Files**
Add a comment to the top of `_config.ts` (or similar files) clarifying the intent:

**Example: `_config.ts`**
```typescript
/**
 * _config.ts - Example configuration file for Lumenous Template.
 *
 * This file is licensed under the MIT license (see LICENSE_Otero.md).
 * However, if you modify this file for your project, you are free to license your changes
 * or the resulting configuration under terms of your choosing.
 *
 * Original Author: Oscar Otero
 */
```

This ensures users understand they are free to modify and relicense the file.

---

### **4. Address in Documentation**
Add a section in your `README.md` or `src/site/README.md` to explain this explicitly:

**Example: Licensing in README.md**
```markdown
### Configuration Files

The configuration files included in this template (e.g., `_config.ts`) are intended as templates to help you get started with your site. While these files are initially covered under the MIT license (see `src/site/LICENSE_Otero.md`), any modifications you make to these files for your project are entirely your responsibility, and you are free to license your changes under terms of your choosing.
```

---

## **Summary of Adjustments**
1. **Root-Level LICENSE.md**: Add a special note clarifying user rights for modifying configuration files.
2. **Per-File Comments**: Include comments in files like `_config.ts` stating the user's right to modify and relicense them.
3. **Documentation**: Add a section in the README explaining the licensing of customizable files.

---

### **Why This Works**
- **Flexibility for Users**: Users can customize configuration files without worrying about the original MIT license applying to their changes.
- **Clarity**: Both the LICENSE file and comments in the configuration files make it clear that user modifications are unrestricted.
- **Respect for Original License**: The MIT license remains intact for unmodified template files.

Let me know if you’d like further refinements or examples for other files!


## it seems much easier to say "portions of this work" than to add a comment to each file.

You're absolutely right—saying "portions of this work" in a centralized licensing file or README is a simpler and more maintainable approach than adding comments to each file. This method works well for projects like `lumenous-template`, where files from different sources and licenses are combined.

Here’s how you can handle licensing with this simplified approach:

---

## **Centralized Licensing with "Portions of This Work"**

### **1. Root-Level `LICENSE.md`**
Create a root-level `LICENSE.md` that specifies:
- The license for your project.
- Attribution to other contributors and their licenses.
- The flexibility for users to modify files like `_config.ts`.

**Example: `LICENSE.md`**
```markdown
# License for Lumenous Template

This project is licensed under the MIT License. See below for details.

## Portions of This Work

1. **Lume Template Files**:
   Portions of this project are derived from the [Lume project](https://lume.land/), created by Oscar Otero and licensed under the MIT License. These include:
   - Files in `src/site/layouts/`
   - Files in `src/site/includes/`
   - Files in `src/site/scripts/`
   - The `_config.ts` configuration file.

   Modifications made to these files for your project are entirely your responsibility. You are free to relicense them under terms of your choosing, provided you adhere to the original license where applicable.

2. **User-Generated Content**:
   Any additional files you add or create (e.g., Markdown files, custom layouts) are not subject to the MIT License unless explicitly stated. You are free to license your content under terms of your choosing.

3. **Generated Site Output**:
   The contents of the `docs/` directory, which are the output of the Lume build process, are not covered by the MIT License. You may distribute them under any license of your choosing.
```

This structure:
- Acknowledges and attributes upstream contributions.
- Clarifies user rights to modify and relicense files.
- Clearly separates licenses for template files, user content, and generated output.

---

### **2. README Clarification**
Update your `README.md` to explain licensing briefly and link to `LICENSE.md`.

**Example: `README.md`**
```markdown
# Lumenous Template

Lumenous is a reusable Lume template designed for generating documentation and static sites. It can be overlaid on an existing project to provide layouts, includes, scripts, and configuration files.

## Licensing

This project is licensed under the MIT License. See `LICENSE.md` for details.

### Key Points:
- Portions of this template are derived from the [Lume project](https://lume.land/) by Oscar Otero, licensed under the MIT License.
- You are free to modify and relicense files like `_config.ts` and others for your project.
- Your custom content (e.g., Markdown files) is not subject to the MIT License unless explicitly stated.
- The generated site (`docs/`) can be distributed under any license of your choosing.
```

---

### **3. Optional: Acknowledge Upstream License in a Separate File**
To provide transparency, you can include a separate `LICENSE_Otero.md` file in the `src/site/` directory with the full text of the upstream MIT license. This avoids cluttering your main license file.

**Example: `src/site/LICENSE_Otero.md`**
```markdown
# MIT License

Copyright (c) Oscar Otero

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software...

[Full MIT license text here]
```

Reference this file in your root `LICENSE.md` under "Portions of This Work."

---

### **Why This Approach Works**
1. **Centralized Licensing**:
   - Simplifies license management.
   - Avoids repetitive comments in individual files.

2. **Clarity for Users**:
   - Clearly delineates the licensing boundaries for template files, user-generated content, and site output.

3. **Flexibility**:
   - Empowers users to relicense files they modify, which is essential for configuration files like `_config.ts`.

---

Let me know if you'd like help drafting any specific sections!

## It seems like I shouldn't be able to allow users to relicense Oscar's files. 

You're absolutely correct: users cannot relicense files derived from Oscar Otero's work under their own terms without adhering to the original license (MIT). What you **can** do is clarify that while users are free to modify these files, they must retain the original license in those files, even after modifications.

Here’s how you can revise the licensing approach to reflect this limitation accurately:

---

## **Revised Licensing Approach**

### **1. Root-Level `LICENSE.md`**
Update the root `LICENSE.md` to clarify that:
- Files originating from Oscar Otero’s Lume project are licensed under MIT and must retain that license.
- Users may modify those files but cannot relicense them.
- User-generated content and the generated output are not governed by this restriction.

**Example: Updated `LICENSE.md`**
```markdown
# License for Lumenous Template

This project is licensed under the MIT License. See below for details.

## Portions of This Work

1. **Template Files Derived from Lume**:
   Portions of this project are derived from the [Lume project](https://lume.land/), created by Oscar Otero and licensed under the MIT License. These include:
   - Files in `src/site/layouts/`
   - Files in `src/site/includes/`
   - Files in `src/site/scripts/`
   - The `_config.ts` configuration file.

   These files remain licensed under the MIT License even if you modify them. You are required to retain the original license notice in any copies or derivatives.

2. **User-Generated Content**:
   Any additional files you add or create (e.g., Markdown files, custom layouts) are not subject to the MIT License unless explicitly stated. You are free to license your content under terms of your choosing.

3. **Generated Site Output**:
   The contents of the `docs/` directory, which are the output of the Lume build process, are not covered by the MIT License. You may distribute them under any license of your choosing.

## Full MIT License
[Include full MIT License text here.]
```

---

### **2. README Clarification**
In the `README.md`, emphasize the licensing requirements for template files.

**Example: `README.md`**
```markdown
# Lumenous Template

Lumenous is a reusable Lume template designed for generating documentation and static sites. It can be overlaid on an existing project to provide layouts, includes, scripts, and configuration files.

## Licensing

This project is licensed under the MIT License. See `LICENSE.md` for details.

### Key Points:
1. Portions of this template are derived from the [Lume project](https://lume.land/) by Oscar Otero, licensed under the MIT License.
   - These files remain under the MIT License, even if you modify them.
   - You must retain the original license notice in any modified versions.
2. Your custom content (e.g., Markdown files) is not subject to the MIT License unless explicitly stated.
3. The generated site (`docs/`) can be distributed under any license of your choosing.
```

---

### **3. Add Comments in Template Files**
To further clarify the license, add comments to the top of files derived from Lume, such as `_config.ts`, `layouts/`, and `includes/`.

**Example: `_config.ts`**
```typescript
/**
 * _config.ts - Example configuration file for Lumenous Template.
 *
 * This file is derived from the Lume project by Oscar Otero and is licensed under the MIT License.
 * See LICENSE_Otero.md for details.
 *
 * You are free to modify this file for your project, but it must remain licensed under the MIT License.
 */
```

This ensures users are reminded of their obligation to retain the MIT license.

---

### **4. Reference Oscar’s License Separately**
Include a `LICENSE_Otero.md` file in `src/site` to clearly attribute and reproduce Oscar’s original MIT license.

**Example: `src/site/LICENSE_Otero.md`**
```markdown
# MIT License

Copyright (c) Oscar Otero

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software...

[Full MIT license text here]
```

---

### **Key Adjustments**
1. **No Relicensing of Template Files**:
   - Users can modify files, but they must retain the MIT license notice.
   - This aligns with the requirements of the MIT license.

2. **Clear Attribution**:
   - Explicitly acknowledge and attribute Oscar Otero’s work in the `LICENSE.md` and documentation.

3. **Flexibility for User Content**:
   - User-generated content and the generated site output are explicitly excluded from the MIT license, giving users freedom to relicense their own work.

---

### **Why This Works**
- **Compliance with MIT License**:
  - Ensures modified versions of the template files remain under the MIT license.
- **Transparency for Users**:
  - Clarifies what users can and cannot do with the template files.
- **Flexibility for Customization**:
  - Users retain freedom over their original content and generated output.

Let me know if this addresses your concerns or if further clarification is needed!

## merging multiple sources (dave)

I've got an great idea. I want multiple repos to be able to contribute to a site. E.g., I'll keep the documentation for the sflow-cli in the sflow-cli repo. I can keep Oscar's template files in a separate repo. The main semantic-flow wiki can be in its own repo. I'll have a separate task, maybe "merge" that pulls latest for all contributing repos and then tries to combine all the sources (checking for naming conflicts). This will allow me to keep Oscar's template separated. Each repo can have its own License. It's analagous (or maybe exactly) what I want to do with semantic flow anyhow... 

## merging multiple sources (chatgpt)

This is an excellent approach! By separating content into individual repositories, you gain modularity, easier license management, and clear boundaries between different types of content and contributors. Here's a high-level plan to help you implement this:

---

### **1. Directory Layout**
Define a structure where each repository contributes specific content.

Example:
```plaintext
main-site/
├── docs/                # Final generated site
├── src/                 # Combined sources from contributing repos
│   ├── template/        # Template files (e.g., from Oscar's repo)
│   ├── sflow-cli/       # sflow-cli documentation repo
│   ├── semantic-flow/   # Main Semantic Flow wiki repo
│   └── [other repos]    # Additional contributors
├── scripts/             # Build and merge scripts
└── lume.config.ts       # Main Lume config for combining sources
```

---

### **2. Each Repository's Role**
- **Template Repository**:
  - Contains only reusable template files (e.g., layouts, includes, scripts).
  - License: MIT (or original license for upstream templates).

- **sflow-cli Repository**:
  - Contains sflow-cli-specific documentation and assets.
  - License: User’s choice (e.g., MIT, Apache, or proprietary).

- **Semantic Flow Wiki Repository**:
  - Contains the main documentation for Semantic Flow.
  - License: User’s choice.

---

### **3. Merge Task**
Create a task (`merge`) to:
1. Pull or fetch the latest from all contributing repositories.
2. Combine their content into a single site structure (`src/`).
3. Resolve naming conflicts (e.g., duplicate filenames or paths).
4. Provide reports/logs for conflicts or skipped files.

#### Example Workflow:
- **Step 1: Clone or Pull Latest**:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/user/template-repo.git src/template/
  git clone https://github.com/user/sflow-cli.git src/sflow-cli/
  git clone https://github.com/user/semantic-flow-wiki.git src/semantic-flow/
  ```

- **Step 2: Merge Content**:
  Use a script to merge directories:
  ```bash
  rsync -a src/template/ src/combined/ --exclude 'docs/'
  rsync -a src/sflow-cli/ src/combined/
  rsync -a src/semantic-flow/ src/combined/
  ```

- **Step 3: Conflict Detection**:
  Check for conflicts (e.g., duplicate paths):
  ```bash
  find src/combined/ -type f | sort | uniq -d > conflicts.log
  ```

---

### **4. Per-Repo Licensing**
By keeping repositories independent, each can maintain its own license. In the final merged site:
- Template files retain their license (e.g., MIT for Oscar’s files).
- Repo-specific content adheres to its own license.
- Generated output (e.g., `docs/`) is licensed based on the site owner’s preferences.

---

### **5. Integration with Lume**
Adjust your `lume.config.ts` to process the combined `src/` directory:
```typescript
import lume from "lume/mod.ts";

const site = lume();

site.copy("src/combined", ".");

export default site;
```

---

### **6. Benefits of This Approach**
- **Modularity**: Each repo focuses on its content and purpose.
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new repositories or contributors.
- **License Clarity**: Each repo's license remains separate.
- **Reuse**: Template files and other shared resources are easily updated and reused.

---

If you need help implementing the merge task, refining the process, or adjusting the structure, let me know! This setup is robust and highly extensible for your Semantic Flow goals.


## specific directories within repos (dave)

You should be able to specify which folder(s) in a repo you want merged. I guess you can't clone just a specific directory though, right?


## specific directories within repos (chatgpt)

You're correct—you can't directly clone a specific directory from a repository using Git. However, there are workarounds to achieve this functionality, allowing you to merge specific directories from contributing repositories. Here’s how you can approach it:

---

## **Options for Including Specific Directories**

### **1. Sparse-Checkout**
Git's sparse-checkout feature lets you clone a repository and check out only specific directories.

#### **Steps:**
1. **Initialize the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git init src/template-repo
   cd src/template-repo
   ```

2. **Set the Remote URL:**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/user/template-repo.git
   ```

3. **Enable Sparse-Checkout:**
   ```bash
   git config core.sparseCheckout true
   ```

4. **Specify the Directories to Include:**
   Add the desired directories to `.git/info/sparse-checkout`:
   ```plaintext
   layouts/
   includes/
   scripts/
   ```

   Alternatively, you can use the Git command:
   ```bash
   echo "layouts/" >> .git/info/sparse-checkout
   echo "includes/" >> .git/info/sparse-checkout
   echo "scripts/" >> .git/info/sparse-checkout
   ```

5. **Pull the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

This will fetch only the specified directories into your working directory.

---

### **2. Git Archive for Specific Directories**
If you don’t need the full Git history, you can use `git archive` to download a specific directory as a ZIP file.

#### **Steps:**
1. **Download a Specific Directory:**
   ```bash
   git archive --remote=https://github.com/user/template-repo.git HEAD layouts/ | tar -x
   ```

2. **Repeat for Other Directories:**
   Run the command for other directories you need (e.g., `includes/`, `scripts/`).

This method is fast and efficient but does not include Git history.

---

### **3. Use `rsync` or Similar Tools After Full Clone**
If sparse-checkout or `git archive` doesn't meet your needs, you can clone the full repository and copy only specific directories.

#### **Steps:**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/user/template-repo.git src/template-repo
   ```

2. Copy specific directories into the combined site folder:
   ```bash
   rsync -a src/template-repo/layouts/ src/combined/layouts/
   rsync -a src/template-repo/includes/ src/combined/includes/
   ```

---

### **4. Create a Script to Automate Repo Merging**
Automate the process for fetching specific directories from multiple repositories using a script.

#### Example Script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Function to clone specific directories
merge_repo() {
  local REPO_URL=$1
  local BRANCH=$2
  local DIRS=$3
  local DEST=$4

  # Clone the repo sparsely
  git init "$DEST"
  cd "$DEST" || exit
  git remote add origin "$REPO_URL"
  git config core.sparseCheckout true

  # Set the directories to include
  for DIR in $DIRS; do
    echo "$DIR" >> .git/info/sparse-checkout
  done

  # Pull the repo
  git pull origin "$BRANCH"
  cd ..
}

# Example usage
merge_repo "https://github.com/user/template-repo.git" "main" "layouts includes scripts" "src/template-repo"
merge_repo "https://github.com/user/sflow-cli.git" "main" "docs examples" "src/sflow-cli"
```

---

## **Comparison of Methods**

| **Method**               | **Pros**                                    | **Cons**                                    |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Sparse-Checkout**      | Fetches only what you need, includes history | Setup is a bit complex, slower for many repos |
| **Git Archive**          | Fast and efficient for specific directories | No Git history is included                 |
| **Full Clone + Rsync**   | Simple and flexible                        | Downloads everything, including unneeded files |
| **Automated Script**     | Scales well for multiple repos             | Requires maintaining a script              |

---

## **Recommendation**
For your use case:
- Use **Sparse-Checkout** if you need Git history for specific directories.
- Use **Git Archive** if you only need the latest version of specific directories.
- Use an **automated script** to combine these approaches and handle multiple repositories efficiently.

## Lume detects changes in my _combined/_src-repos/ directories, but we need to re-trigger the copying. 

To re-trigger the copying when changes are detected in your `_combined/_src-repos/` directories, you can leverage **Lume’s event hooks** or a file watcher like Deno's `watchFs` API. The idea is to monitor `_src-repos` for changes and then run the copy logic whenever a change occurs.

Here’s how you can set this up:

---

### Approach 1: Use Lume Preprocessing Hooks

Lume's `preprocess` hook can monitor and react to changes in files.

#### Updated `_config.ts`

```typescript
import lume from "lume/mod.ts";
import multiSourcePlugin from "./multiSourcePlugin.ts";
import { ensureDir } from "https://deno.land/std/fs/mod.ts";

// Define the directories
const srcDir = "_combined";
const repoDir = `${srcDir}/_src-repos`;

// Ensure directories exist
await ensureDir(repoDir);

// Trigger initial copying
await multiSourcePlugin([
  {
    url: "https://github.com/djradon/lumenous-template/",
    include: ["demo", "template"],
  },
  {
    url: "https://github.com/another-repo/example/",
    include: ["src", "docs"],
  },
], repoDir);

// Set up Lume site
const site = lume({
  src: srcDir,
});

// Preprocess to trigger copying on file changes
site.preprocess(["_src-repos/**/*"], async () => {
  console.log("Detected changes in _src-repos, re-triggering copying...");
  await multiSourcePlugin([
    {
      url: "https://github.com/djradon/lumenous-template/",
      include: ["demo", "template"],
    },
    {
      url: "https://github.com/another-repo/example/",
      include: ["src", "docs"],
    },
  ], repoDir);
});

export default site;
```

---

### Explanation

1. **Preprocessing Hook**:
   - `site.preprocess(["_src-repos/**/*"], callback)` watches for changes in `_src-repos`.
   - When changes are detected, it runs the `multiSourcePlugin` to re-trigger the copying process.

2. **Initial Copying**:
   - Copying logic is triggered once initially before setting up Lume.

3. **Re-Copy on Change**:
   - When any file in `_src-repos` is modified, the preprocessing hook runs, calling `multiSourcePlugin` again.

---

### Approach 2: Use `Deno.watchFs`

For more granular control or if you’re running outside Lume's hooks, use Deno's `watchFs` API to monitor changes and trigger copying.

#### Example Script

```typescript
import { watchFs } from "https://deno.land/std/fs/mod.ts";
import multiSourcePlugin from "./multiSourcePlugin.ts";
import { ensureDir } from "https://deno.land/std/fs/mod.ts";

const srcDir = "_combined";
const repoDir = `${srcDir}/_src-repos`;

// Ensure directories exist
await ensureDir(repoDir);

// Trigger initial copying
await multiSourcePlugin([
  {
    url: "https://github.com/djradon/lumenous-template/",
    include: ["demo", "template"],
  },
  {
    url: "https://github.com/another-repo/example/",
    include: ["src", "docs"],
  },
], repoDir);

// Watch for changes in the _src-repos directory
console.log(`Watching for changes in ${repoDir}...`);
for await (const event of watchFs(repoDir)) {
  console.log("Detected change:", event);

  // Re-trigger copying on any file change
  if (event.kind === "modify" || event.kind === "create" || event.kind === "remove") {
    console.log("Re-triggering copying due to changes in _src-repos...");
    await multiSourcePlugin([
      {
        url: "https://github.com/djradon/lumenous-template/",
        include: ["demo", "template"],
      },
      {
        url: "https://github.com/another-repo/example/",
        include: ["src", "docs"],
      },
    ], repoDir);
  }
}
```

---

### Pros and Cons

| Approach        | Pros                                      | Cons                                      |
|------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Lume Hook**    | Directly integrates into Lume’s workflow | Limited to changes detected by Lume       |
| **Deno.watchFs** | Detects any file system changes          | Adds complexity if run alongside Lume     |

---

### Recommendation

- **If you are already using Lume**: Use **Approach 1**. It integrates seamlessly with your existing Lume setup.
- **For standalone workflows**: Use **Approach 2** to monitor changes and handle them independently.

## dont retrigger everything (dave), new repo lume-multisource

Let's try #1. But we definitely don't want to retrigger the whole default function that would empty re-pull (and presumably error when trying to overwrite the changed file). But I want to break out my multiSourcePlugin to its own repo, djradon/lume-multisource. Let's address that before we try to break out the "Copy included paths into _combined" into its own function.
