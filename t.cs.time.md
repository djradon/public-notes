## Allen's interval algebra


### Implementations

-   [A simple java library implementing the concept of Allen's temporal relations and the path consistency algorithm](https://code.google.com/p/allenintervalrelationships/)
-   [Java library implementing Allen's Interval Algebra](https://github.com/Breinify/brein-time-utilities) (incl. data and index structures, e.g., [interval tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_tree "Interval tree"))
-   [OWL-Time Time Ontology in OWL](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-time/) an OWL-2 DL ontology of temporal concepts, for describing the temporal properties of resources in the world or described in Web pages.
-   [GQR](https://github.com/m-westphal/gqr) is a reasoner for Allen's interval algebra (and many others)
-   [qualreas](https://github.com/alreich/qualreas) is a Python framework for qualitative reasoning over networks of relation algebras, such as RCC-8, Allen's interval algebra, and Allen's algebra integrated with Time Points and situated in either Left- or Right-Branching Time.
-   [SparQ](https://github.com/dwolter/SparQ) is a reasoner for Allen's interval algebra (and many others)
-   [EveXL](https://www.metaphorofitself.net/evexl-introduction) is a small domain-specific language for the detection of events that implements the Interval Algebra's operators via ASCII art patterns.
