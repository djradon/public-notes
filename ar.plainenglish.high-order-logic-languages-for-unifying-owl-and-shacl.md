## Questions

- Do you have any hope for relator-based ontologies to represent hypergraphs in RDF, i.e., where the relationship (traditionally a predicate) is reified as an object? Perhaps this is what you're referring to as "artificial entities or complex reification patterns", but relationships shouldn't be considered artificial, and in my opinion, the patterns can be quite intuitive.
