- "a lover of postmodern technology who hates postmodern theory, a digital-media scholar with the reference points of an old-fashioned literary critic, a literary critic who writes in the future tense"
- "does not share the “naïve optimism” of the futurist @ray-kurzweil, for instance, who heralds the moment when human intelligence will merge with A.I.—or of the V.R. entrepreneur @chris-milk, who believes that virtual reality can instill empathy in people like a moral software update. She prefers the rationalism, and the humanism, of old-fashioned science fiction."
