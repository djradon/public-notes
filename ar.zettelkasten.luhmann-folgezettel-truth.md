    - 1. What most people think Luhmanns Zettelkasten is about: It is the linking through tags and cross-references.
    - 2. What it is actually about: It is mainly about the concept of Folgezettel. This means that you develop an idea in a linear way and branch off if the next thought doesn’t fit into the previous string of ideas.
- [[p.argues]] no good reason for [[t.km.folgezettel]]
  - "We don’t have a physical Zettelkasten and we can connect notes with links. The intent of a Folgezettel is not always clear, so we can even improve the situation by creating annotated links."
