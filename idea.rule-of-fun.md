    - 'real' swordfights were typically very brutal and incredibly brief, which is the antithesis of 'fun' in an RPG; thus, we have Hit Points.
      - [[p.provokedThoughts]] 
        - [[game.odyssey]] captures the brutality nicely
        - maybe a little more strategy that just fight or run
- [[t.cs.game.if]] might not be fun because reading isn't fun; not to mention the open-world tension
