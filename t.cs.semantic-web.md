## CURIEs

- a CURIE (Compact URI) is a compact representation of a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). CURIEs are designed to shorten the lengthy URIs often used in Semantic Web technologies, making them more manageable and easier to read. The structure of a CURIE is generally divided into two parts: a prefix and a reference. 
  - e.g.: `foaf:Person`
