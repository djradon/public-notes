## Highlights

- in the Vertebrate Taxonomy Ontology (VTO) (Phenoscape, 2021) and the NCBI Taxonomy (NCBI, 2021), all biological species are modelled as classes
- In contrast, in the Wildlife Ontology (WO) (BBC, 2021) and in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF, 2021), biological species are modelled as instances.
  - The authors of the WO state on (BBC, 2021): “One perennial problem associated with modelling biological taxonomies using RDF is whether to attempt to model individual species as classes, or whether to simply model species as instances of a generic Species class. The latter approach is simpler and avoids creating a huge ontology that attempts to model all biological organisms. Existing ontologies have taken different approaches to resolving this issue, some choosing one style, others another. At present there doesn’t seem to be a consensus. With this in mind, the Wildlife Ontology adopts the simpler of the two approaches, i.e. modelling species as instances of a Species class, as this maximises interoperability with many of the existing Linked Data sources, particularly dbpedia, which adopt similar approaches.”
