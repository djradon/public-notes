## Description

- simple library designed to manage state in games, particularly distributed state in a client/server architecture. It supports both Clojure and ClojureScript, so is particularly suitable for web-based games.
- Ittyon draws inspiration from the entity component model, but provides a greater separation between code and data. Its data model has a lot in common with Datomic.
