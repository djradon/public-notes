## Summary

- Track Version Information within the Ontology
  - Tracking the version number in the URL means that the namespace changes with every new update, which can cause difficulties with software integrations. As a result, this method of version tracking is generally not recommended.
- Use the Semantic Versioning (SEMVER) Standard
- Have a Plan for Deprecation
- Keep a changelog
- Deliver the right version
  - t.2024.07.16.11 seems slightly inconsistent with not tracking version number in the URL
