#aka "came up with on", "invented on", "was started on"

## [[p.provokedThoughts]]

using the #created tag works around some thorny complexities
  - for "creation times" (to the minute) in English you would say "created at {time} on {date}" 
  - for "creation hour", you would say "created around {time, to the nearest hour} on {date}"
  - for "creation month", you would say "created in {month} of {year}"
  - for "creation year", you would say "created in {year}"
