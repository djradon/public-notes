we're not going prevent IRI collisions. But each top-level folder within an SFDataRepo names a namespace within the site. Each site has a SFRootRepo which contains a docs folder for the generated site, and the generated site has a top-level "/ns" folder below which all the namespaces live and then other folders like "/assets" where site scripts, images, css, etc can live.  The top-level folder in a SFRootRepo should have the metalsmith files, including a "/templates" folder and a "/mappings" folder that specifies which templates should apply to which semantic index.html "de-referencing" pages. SFDataRepo repos could also have "/_templates" and "/_mappings" special folder at the top level for metalsmith-sflo to pick up and integrate. Please regenerate the description but not in a canvas, because when I copy from a canvas it doesn't paste as markdown.

I wouldn't say "represents a distinct namespace" because the same namespace can have a top-level folder in multiple SFDataRepos. maybe "corresponds to a namespace". Please remove the "Prefix Control" bullet, SFDataRepos should not get their own unique prefix. Under redirection/aliasing, it will use the site's base IRI (from a configuration file), and the idea with owl:sameAs aliasing is this:

SFDataRepos should be designed so that IRI references are relative to the base and on initial generation of the site, you should be able to specify (for the entire SFDataRepo or on whatever granularity) whether you want pre-existing files with different bases to be re-based onto the current site. This amounts to mirroring external RDF data to the new site. Maybe you can specify re-basing at any point. Then, for new data, datasets will pick up with the next version, catalog series will be re-based into the new, current site. In the case that different SFDataRepos have overlapping namespaces with overlapping individuals and those individuals have overlapping dataset-series, hopefully it's clear that one is an extension of the other, but if not, metalsmith-sflo will have to choose or prompt which is the current one and fix the individual's sflo:has_default_catalog_series properties. 

Please add to the description the approach that sflo is dataset-series-oriented (dataset series provide versioning and metadata for individuals), and that individuals that aren't already sflo:DatasetSeries get _default and _catalog series created for them.

Here is the updated description for Metalsmith-SFLO:

**Metalsmith-SFLO: Enhancing RDF and Namespace Management for Static Sites**

**Metalsmith-SFLO** is a flexible static site generator that builds on the **Metalsmith** framework to provide a streamlined approach for managing **RDF data** and **namespaces**. Its primary focus is to handle datasets, catalogs, and IRIs effectively, making it ideal for building **semantic web** content from distributed repositories of RDF data. Here's what Metalsmith-SFLO offers:

### Key Features:

1. **Flexible Namespace and Dataset Management**:
   - Supports multiple **namespaces per repository**, and also allows **multiple repositories** to contribute to a single namespace.
   - Namespace folders correspond to a **namespace hierarchy**, providing the structure for the data.
   - Contributing repositories (`sfDataRepos`) can expand existing namespaces without directly modifying the original data. This allows the inclusion of **read-only data from external sources**, with contributors being able to add their own data on top of it.

2. **IRI Minting and Collision Management**:
   - When generating a new site from existing data, the generator can automatically handle **IRI redirection and aliasing** through `owl:sameAs`. SFDataRepos should be designed with IRI references relative to the base, and during initial site generation, users can specify whether they want pre-existing files with different bases to be re-based onto the current site. This effectively mirrors external RDF data to the new site. New datasets will pick up from the next version, and catalog series will be re-based into the new site base. In cases where multiple SFDataRepos have overlapping namespaces and individuals with overlapping dataset series, Metalsmith-SFLO will prompt the user or make a decision to determine which dataset series is current and update the individual's `sflo:has_default_catalog_series` properties accordingly.

3. **Dynamic Dataset Drafting and Versioning**:
   - Metalsmith-SFLO is dataset-series-oriented, meaning that dataset series provide versioning and metadata for individuals. Any individual that is not already a `sflo:DatasetSeries` will have `_default` and `_catalog` series automatically created for them. Metalsmith-SFLO supports both **current** and **draft** states for datasets. The **current dataset** acts as the main working version, while users can start individual drafts, but only updates to `current` are eventually minted as new versions. Users can manage **draft versions** using a consistent IRI alias (`/current`) that represents the most recent dataset. Draft IRIs may have more specific identifiers (e.g., `/draft-2024-10-30-username`) to keep things organized and distinguishable.

4. **Site-Level Integration**:
   - Metadata and versioning information can be generated for **individual entities**, for an **entire namespace**, or across **all namespaces**.
   - During the build process, `sfDataRepos` are synchronized and scanned for changes. The system then triggers catalog and dataset updates where necessary, minting new versions only upon official release (not for every edit).

5. **Publication and Flexibility**:
   - Users can configure whether the content of their `sfDataRepos` is published, and even **obscure sensitive names** through aliasing.
   - **Selective inclusion**: Some `sfDataRepos` may not be published, but they can still contribute data to catalogs and extend namespaces indirectly. The static site generator handles this dynamically by managing visibility and integration.

6. **User Responsibility and Automation**:
   - The system provides tools to manage **IRI collisions**, but the responsibility ultimately lies with contributors to avoid duplicating existing IRIs. Metalsmith-SFLO includes automatic collision checks and prompts during site generation, ensuring contributors are alerted to any conflicts.
   - Automated processes ensure that whenever a new version is generated, catalogs and namespace information are properly updated. Contributors can also rely on the generator to suggest new base IRIs when reusing existing datasets.

### Workflow Summary:
- **Initial Setup**: Users select existing `sfDataRepos` or namespaces to create a new site.
- **IRI Minting and Equivalency**: The generator handles new base IRIs and inserts `owl:sameAs` statements to preserve links to original data.
- **Drafting and Collaboration**: All changes occur in the **current draft** until ready for a new version, minimizing unnecessary versions while allowing individual experimentation.
- **Build and Versioning**: The build process includes automatic scanning of changes, merging updates, and updating catalogs, with the system controlling when new versions are minted to maintain consistency.

**Metalsmith-SFLO** is designed to make RDF-based static site generation intuitive, flexible, and scalable, providing powerful tools for namespace management, data integration, and version control. Whether you are building from scratch or extending existing data, Metalsmith-SFLO adapts to the complexity of your semantic data needs, while keeping the workflow streamlined and clear.
