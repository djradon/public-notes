  - "Properties are those entities that can be predicated of things or, in other words, attributed to them. Thus, properties are often called predicables. Other terms for them are “attributes”, “qualities”, “features”, “characteristics”, “types”. Properties are also ways things are, entities that things exemplify or instantiate. For example, if we say that this is a leaf and is green, we are attributing the properties leaf and green to it, and, if the predication is veridical, the thing in question exemplifies these properties."
  - According to a different conception, however, properties are themselves particulars, though _abstract_ ones. As so conceived, properties are nowadays commonly called [tropes](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/properties//../tropes/)
