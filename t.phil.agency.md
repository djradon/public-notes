## What is an agent?

- ["they act and their actions have consequences, they also resist conditions which they do not like and, in some circumstances, are able to change the conditions of their agency"][1]

- ["Margaret Archer defines Corporate Agency as involving both formulating goals and actively organizing in order to reach them. Primary Agency does not show either of these characteristics."][2]

- ["Formal Corporate Agency (stated aims and coordinated action); Informal Corporate Agency (no stated aims but coordinated action); Withdrawn Agency (stated aims but no coordinated action); and Primary Agency (no stated aims and no coordinated action)."][2]
