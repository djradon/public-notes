## Summarize

I'll read through your ko, weave, and sflow files to understand the current state. Let me examine them systematically:Now let me read these files to understand the current state. I'll start with the key files:Now let me examine some key concepts and conversation files:Let me also check the work/expression file reference and some more key files:## Summary

Based on my examination of your ko., weave, and sflow files, here's what I've found (.8):

### **Kosmion (ko.*)** 
A foundational ontology with a radical "relator-compound" approach (.9):
- **Core Innovation**: Everything is a relationship using "relator compounds" instead of traditional RDF triples (.8)
- **Key Features**: N-ary relations, system-time tracking, multi-perspective modeling, rich provenance at the relationship level (.8)
- **Philosophy**: Human-first, domain-first approach that avoids forcing users into predefined hierarchies (.7)
- **Status**: Conceptually developed but unorthodox - likely breaks existing tooling (.6)

### **Semantic Flow (sflow.*)** 
An IRI minting + versioning system (.9):
- **Purpose**: Provides "friendly pages" for IRIs plus immutable versioning for data that changes over time (.9)
- **Features**: Dataset-series orientation, GitHub/GitLab namespace management, reference page generation (.8)
- **Relationship**: Works alongside Kosmion but designed to be ontology-agnostic (.7)

### **Weave (proj.weave.*)** 
A CLI tool for combining resources (.7):
- **Purpose**: General-purpose syncing/merging across repositories (.8)
- **Status**: Seems less developed, possibly merging conceptually with sflow (.6)

## Big Issues to Clarify

### 1. **Work/Expression/Manifestation/Item (WEMI) Problem** (.8)
This is fundamentally about **versioning and identity**. Your notes show the classic FRBR confusion: when someone refers to "Hamlet," do they mean:
- The abstract work (Platonic form)
- A specific text/translation (expression)  
- A particular publication (manifestation)
- A physical copy (item)

**For your systems**: This maps directly to your "two classes of IRIs" challenge (.7).

### 2. **Resources That Refer vs Resources That Are** (.8)
The httpRange-14 problem: when you have `https://example.com/hamlet`, does that IRI identify:
- The information resource (the web page/document)
- The thing being described (Hamlet the character/play)

### 3. **Two Classes of IRIs** (.9)
From your breakthrough conversation: you need both:
- **Mutable pointers** (`:latestVersion` style) for practical navigation
- **Immutable identifiers** for specific versions/states

But mutable pointers break your immutability principle (.7).

### 4. **DCAT and Named Graphs** (.6)
You're exploring using DCAT for dataset series and named graphs for versioning, but there are complex interactions with your relator-compound approach (.5).

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Product Boundaries** (.8): Should Kosmion remain a pure foundational ontology while sflow handles the practical IRI/versioning concerns? Or do they need deeper integration?

2. **WEMI Mapping** (.7): In your system, how do you want to handle someone referencing "Hamlet" without a version? Do you:
   - Redirect to latest version
   - Show a disambiguation page with all versions
   - Use dataset series as the "work" level

3. **Immutability vs Practicality** (.8): Are you comfortable having "two classes of IRIs" where some are mutable pointers for navigation, breaking pure immutability?

4. **Relator-Compound Adoption** (.6): Given that relator compounds will break existing tooling, what's your migration/adoption strategy?

These seem to be the core tensions you're working through (.7). What aspect would you like to dive deeper into?
