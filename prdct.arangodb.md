  - "each vertex in our application is joined by a single edge to an in-proxy vertex and to an out-proxy vertex. Then, each edge in our application connects the out-proxy of its source vertex to the in-proxy of its target vertex. In this way, when we modify a vertex, we need only copy it, and itâ€™s proxy edges. The proxy vertices remain stable with respect to application edges." ^70wne4dgjwqz
