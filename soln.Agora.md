## Features

- >"lightweight conventions for sense making"
- >"Edges are `wikilinks` referring to other nodes as found in volunteered subnodes. They are labeled by context, e.g. by adjacency or proximity to other links. This gives the graph hypergraph-like qualities, which will be expounded on later.
