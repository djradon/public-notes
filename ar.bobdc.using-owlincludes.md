## Discussion


### Why do you include the data in the ontology rather than the other way around?

What makes the most sense to me, which would be easy enough using owl:includes, would be to have a separate skeleton document that has one pointer to the data document and another pointer to the ontology to say that, for a given processing need, these two are to be used together.
