- [[p.hasSite]] https://fusejs.io/
- [[p.hasUseCase]]
  - When you want client-side fuzzy searching of small to moderately large data sets.
  - When you can't justify setting up a dedicated backend simply to handle search. [[soln.ElasticSearch]] or [[soln.Algolia]], although both great services, may be overkill for your particular use cases
