## Highlights

### Chapter 1: Understanding Conceptual Systems

- the phrase that we “play in” an adventure as op- posed to playing a board game wherein we just “play it” separates the two forms as distinct concepts
- An open system can create, animate and inform a multiplicity of extensible systems while this is never true with a closed system. 

### Classic D&D

- directed play with mutable rules intimately leagued with open play forms with no conceptual boundaries. 
  - It brought with it a need to create resources for it to be played, either in pre-game design sessions or during the game itself by way of its participants being able to instantly extrapolate upon what was being conceptualized. 
- merger of conceptual and mechanical systems
  - resulting “super-system” is in systems theory parlance comprised of non-linear and linear (and/or isolated) systems that have standing relationships with each other. 
  - mechanics often come into focus when there is a need to ascertain the probabilities for success of a player’s interactions within the fantastic surround

### Later variations

-  predominated by mechanics and hard-fast and immutable rules.
- growing presumption that GM-created game matter was now the province of “professional creators” 
  -  users were being incrementally disfranchised from D&D’s original creative crucible as mere consumers of those creations. 
-  whatever the GMs proposed to their players was being ignored by the latter for scaling up their characters to defeat more and more powerful adversaries
-  a game’s mode delineates the expression paths for its participants. ^lqmkhcoab660
