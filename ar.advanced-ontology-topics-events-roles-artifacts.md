## Highlights

### Design Principles

- Take identity seriously
  - Different identity criteria imply disjoint classes
- Isolate a basic taxonomic structure
  - Every entity must instantiate a rigid property with identity
  - Physical objects can change parts and remain the same, but amounts of matter cannot
  - Only sortals like “person” (as opposite to “red”) are good candidates for being taxons (classes in subclass relation)
  - Sortals: objects which carry identity
  - Categories: objects which generalize sortals
- Make an explicit distinction between types and roles (and
other property kinds)


### Events

- Events of all kinds are associated with a "preparation", or activity that brings the event about, and a "consequent", or ensuring state, in a tripartite data structure (from Moens, 1987): preparation :: event :: consequent
