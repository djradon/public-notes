## Features

- Artificial agents creation and life cycle management
- An organizational infrastructure for communication between agents, structuring the application
- High heterogeneity in agent architectures: No predefined agent model
- Multi-Agent based simulation and simulator authoring tools
- Multi-agent based distributed application authoring facilities


## Approach

In contrast to conventional approaches, which are mostly agent-centered, MaDKit follows an organization-centered approach (OCMAS): There is no predefnied agent model in MaDKit.

Especially, MaDKit does not enforce any consideration about the internal structure of agents, thus allowing a developer to freely implements its own agent architectures.

So, MaDKit is built upon the AGR (Agent/Group/Role) organizational model: Agents play roles in groups and thus create artificial societies.
