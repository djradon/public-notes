## Features

- compared to [[prdct.dolce.dns-ultralite]], provides
  - additional properties and classes for modeling participation in events
  - parthood relations, causal relations, and correlations between
events
  -  ability to assert that multiple models represent views
upon or interpretations of the same event
- causal relationships between events and interpretations of the same event by different humans
- "By introducing certain types of events and situations, events can be composed to form more complex situations, such as mereological composi- tions of events or causality relations among events." ^uh1jn8phbw3o


## Issues

- imports from swiped-domain http://www.loa-cnr.it/ontologies/DUL.owl
- why are EventType and EventRole equivalent
- "the F-Event model does not suggest how to distinguish among different kinds of participants in an event." ^le51vrhfwetp
