## [[p.hasExample]]

- ["When paired with a screw (another product) and a carpenter (a service), the screwdriver is part of a solution for building a home."][4]


## thoughts

- "problems" is just so negative
  - [some sources][2] refer to "business problems or opportunities"
    - need a name/Class for those two things
- features can be solutions too
  - sometimes you don't need a full product to solve a problem
    - some might argue that 
  - if you buy "capabilities are collections of features", then capabilities can also be solutions.
