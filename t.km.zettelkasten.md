## [[p.vs]]

### [[t.tm.getting-things-done]]

- zk supports writing and open-ended objectives; gtd relies on clearly defined objectives
- gtd requires breaking down projects into smaller, concrete next steps

### [[t.km.digital-gardening]]

- the slip-box is a lot like a digital garden, but not necessarily [[ar.swyx.learn-in-public]]
- maybe digital gardening doesn't specify the rest of the note-taking methodology. 
- digital garden is more high-level / contentful than, at least, my notes

## @niklas-luhman speaks through others

### "needs of a communication system"

- without surprise or disappointment thereâ€™s no information
- information
- complexity
