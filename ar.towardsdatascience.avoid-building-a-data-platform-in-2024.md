## Highlights

- the cloud computing model of a platform: provides developers with a platform to build, deploy, and manage applications without dealing with the underlying infrastructure.
- The fact that we distinguish between logic and data should not steer our thinking towards an architecture with a separate application platform and data platform.
- The business is process-driven and not data-driven as all companies eagerly try to transform to.
