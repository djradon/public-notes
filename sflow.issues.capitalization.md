## RDF Identifiers

- favor kabab-case for identifiers
- require lower case everywhere. 
- ~~support capitals for proper names or capitalization-sensitive things, like word marks and titles (e.g. eXistenZ), otherwise we're losing information~~

## Filenames

- since filenames shadow identifier names, they should follow identifier rules
- underscores are allowed for system-composed file or directory names like dave-richardson_v1.trig or _catalog
