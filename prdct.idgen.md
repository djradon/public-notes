## Features

- using the IdStructure class you can tune the structure of the created Id's to your own needs; you can use 45 bits for the timestamp, 2 bits for the generator-id and 16 bits for the sequence if you prefer. As long as all 3 parts (timestamp, generator and sequence) add up to 63 bits you're good to go!
