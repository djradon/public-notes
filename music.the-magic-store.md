## Lyrics

[Part 1: The Magic Store]

[Verse 1: Kermit]
It starts when we're kids
A show-off in school
Makin' faces at friends
You're a clown and a fool
Doin' prat-falls and bird-calls
And bad imitations
Ignoring your homework
Is that dedication?
You work through the mirror
You're getting standing ovations

[Verse 2: Fozzie, Miss Piggy, and various Muppets]
You're burning with hope
You're building up steam
What was once juvenilish is grown-up and stylish
You're close to your dream
Then somebody out there loves you
Stands up and hollers for more (More!)
You found a home at the Magic Store

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Part 2: Rainbow Connection (Reprise)]

[Verse 3: Kermit, Fozzie, Gonzo, Miss Piggy, and various Muppets]
Why are there so many songs about rainbows
That's part of what rainbows do
Rainbows are memories, sweet dream reminders
What is it you'd like to do
All of us watching and wishing we find it
I noticed you're watching, too
Someday you'll find it, the Rainbow Connection
The lovers, the dreamers and...

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Outro: Kermit and various Muppets]
Life's like a movie
Write your own ending
Keep believing
Keep pretending
We've done just what we've set out to do
Thanks to the lovers, the dreamers, and you
