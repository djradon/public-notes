  - Using Go for WebAssembly offers several advantages. First, Go provides a familiar and straightforward programming environment for web developers, making it easy to transition from traditional Go development to web development.
  - Secondly, Goâ€™s performance and concurrency features are well-suited for building efficient web applications that can handle heavy workloads.
  - Finally, the combination of Go and WebAssembly allows for cross-platform compatibility, enabling the deployment of applications on various browsers without the need for plugins or additional dependencies.
