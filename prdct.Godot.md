## Features

- publish to web
  - [[c.Issue]]  ^x343t4fze5lf
    - #t.2023.10.09 Projects written in C# using Godot 4 currently cannot be exported to the web. To use C# on web platforms, use Godot 3 instead.
    - Godot 4's HTML5 exports currently cannot run on macOS and iOS due to upstream bugs with SharedArrayBuffer and WebGL 2.0.
- dynamic execution
  - @tool makes scripts execute in the editor  https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/plugins/running_code_in_the_editor.html ^lk1riz8a7a5e
    - e.g. If your player doesn't use a sprite, but draws itself using code, you can make that drawing code execute in the editor to see your player.

  - Using Go for WebAssembly offers several advantages. First, Go provides a familiar and straightforward programming environment for web developers, making it easy to transition from traditional Go development to web development.
  - Secondly, Goâ€™s performance and concurrency features are well-suited for building efficient web applications that can handle heavy workloads.
  - Finally, the combination of Go and WebAssembly allows for cross-platform compatibility, enabling the deployment of applications on various browsers without the need for plugins or additional dependencies.
