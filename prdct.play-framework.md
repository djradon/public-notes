## History

- Play 3.0 introduces a significant update in the platform's development - the shift from Akka to Apache Pekko. Apache Pekko is a branch of Akka 2.6.x that has already experienced some evolution and brought in some unique ideas. Play 3.0 employs Pekko and its HTTP components, indicating a further direction in the modernisation of the framework's infrastructure... There's been a new wave of solutions in the Java world, like Micronaut and Quarkus, that have effectively dominated the market for those seeking an alternative to Spring.
