## Abstract

This is a commentary on the article by Augusto (2022; this issue) on cate- gories and foundation ontology (FO). We agree that the notion of categories of kinds of elements to devise a FO deserves more attention than it has received to date. From a practical point of view sensu developing domain ontologies, however, it probably does not matter much as long as a FO is used and that that one was understood.


## Highlights

- A descriptive ontology such as [[prdct.dolce]] allows entities that are dependent on human thoughts and beliefs to be represented while a realist ontology such as [[prdct.basic-formal-ontology]] aims for the representation of entities that are free of that.
