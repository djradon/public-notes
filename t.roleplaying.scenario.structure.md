## Issues

- "The game holds out the promise of characters advancing into truly epic levels of power — founding kingdoms in AD&D, becoming literal gods in Basic D&D, the _Epic Level Handbook_ in 3<sup>rd</sup> Edition, the Paragon and Epic tiers of 4<sup>th</sup> Edition — but a significant portion of the fanbase has mostly been interested in playing Aragorn and Conan (i.e., fairly gritty fantasy heroes [rooted pretty firmly in reality](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/587/roleplaying-games/dd-calibrating-your-expectations-2))."
- "as you gain the powers of a demigod, the scenario structure of the dungeon — exploring an unknown location one room at a time — begins to fall apart"
- "they also shred railroads: It becomes increasingly difficult for a DM to force their players to do stuff as the power level and options available to the PCs proliferate."
