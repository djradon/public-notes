## The Three Laws

1. Critic Markup shall be human readable. A human with a simple text editor can easily read and comprehend any text containing Critic Markup.
2. Critic Markup shall be computer readable except where it conflicts with rule 1. Markup syntax should be easily parsed with simple regular expressions to support a wide variety of implementations.
3. Critic Markup shall be compatible with existing markup syntax for Markdown, MultiMarkdown and HTML except where it conflicts with rules one or two. Many users of plain text write in combinations of Markdown and HTML. Critic Markup should work alongside that syntax.
