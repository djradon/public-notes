## Features

- You can dynamically modify workflows at runtime! As soon as you save the changed code, COPPER compiles it automatically and loads it.
- You can implement both real-time tasks as well as persistent long-running tasks.
- One of its key features is the asynchronous workflow processing that supports the processing of a large number of workflow threads in parallel without facing operating system thread count limitations.
- With COPPER, you can easily implement high-performance transaction systems.
