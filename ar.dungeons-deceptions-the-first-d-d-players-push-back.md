## Highlights

- “Role-playing games first began in 1971,”says @dave-arneson
  - “Don’t ask me why I know that because I’m the one who did it,” he says. “Backed up by court documents. Thank you.”
- @griffith-morgan The reason why I know the mechanics don’t matter when you’re looking at the research in roleplaying games is once D&D was released, you end up with a mass of copy games coming out and they all have different mechanics. But they’re all using the thing D&D does, and that’s role-playing.
