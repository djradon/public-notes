## Highlights

- “Role-playing games first began in 1971,”says @dave-arneson
  - “Don’t ask me why I know that because I’m the one who did it,” he says. “Backed up by court documents. Thank you.”
- @griffith-morgan The reason why I know the mechanics don’t matter when you’re looking at the research in roleplaying games is once D&D was released, you end up with a mass of copy games coming out and they all have different mechanics. But they’re all using the thing D&D does, and that’s role-playing. 
- @rob-kuntz:  
  - “Arneson set up his 3-ring binder as a screen between us and him,” wrote Kuntz in an unpublished work called A Tale of Two Daves, Two Gygaxʼs and Two Kuntzʼs, which he shared with Kotaku. “He noted that Dave Megarry, a regular in his game, would be our guide for the adventure. Megarry did most of the interfacing and explaining what it was we were about to do with imaginary characters. Arneson noted that we could be either heroes or wizards. Gary chose to be a wizard and the rest of us heroes.” ^yvlscv5xaros
