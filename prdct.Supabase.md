- description: Supabase labels itself as "an open source Firebase alternative". It is a collection of open source tools that together mimic many Firebase features, most of them by providing a wrapper around a PostgreSQL database. While it has realtime queries that run over the wire, like with RethinkDB, Supabase has no client-side storage or replication feature and therefore is not offline first.
