## description

- RuleBook makes use of the concept of “Facts”, which is data supplied to rules. RuleBook allows rules to modify the state of facts, which then can be read and modified by rules further down the chain. For those rules that read in data (Facts) of one type and output a result of a different type, RuleBook has Decisions.
