## Description

- A TriG document allows writing down an RDF Dataset in a compact textual form. It consists of a sequence of directives, triple statements, graph statements which contain triple-generating statements and optional blank lines. 
- Graph statements are a pair of an IRI or blank node label and a group of triple statements surrounded by {}. The IRI or blank node label of the graph statement may be used in another graph statement which implies taking the union of the tripes generated by each graph statement. An IRI or blank node label used as a graph label may also reoccur as part of any triple statement. Optionally a graph statement may not not be labeled with an IRI. Such a graph statement corresponds to the Default Graph of an RDF Dataset.
