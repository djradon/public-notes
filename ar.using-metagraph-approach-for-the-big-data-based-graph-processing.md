## Highlights

- "Thus, the metagraph is a complex graph model, whereas the hypergraph is a near flat graph model that does not fully implement the emergence principle."

## [[c.conclusion]]

- The key element of the metagraph model is metavertex. From the general system theory point of view, a metavertex is a particular case of the manifestation of the emergence principle, which means that a metavertex with its private attributes and connections becomes a whole that cannot be separated into its component parts.
- The metagraph model is a complex graph model, whereas the hypergraph is a near flat graph model that does not fully implement the emergence principle. Also, the metagraph model is more flexible than the hypernetwork model.
- The main elements of the metagraph data model may be represented in textual form using the predicate description.
- The metagraph model may be transformed into a flat graph model based on the multipartite graphs.
- The generalized structure of the metagraph Big Data processing engine makes it possible to process the metagraph datausing the traditional “Big Data flat graph processing engine.”
