## General


### gUFO 

- gUFO has [[prdct.ontouml]] so perhaps more/easier applicability to software models
- (somewhere) was intended for conceptual modeling, including simulation modeling
  - @chatgpt: "Unlike GFO and DOLCE, which have their roots in formal ontology and linguistic cognition respectively, UFO is designed to address the practical needs of conceptual modeling and simulation."
- Instances of gufo:Type are classes, and should specialize the taxonomy of individuals of gUFO. For example, \"Person\" is a gufo:Type (more specifically a gufo:Kind), specializing gufo:Object. The mechanism that allows for this is called punning in OWL 2.


## Abstract/Particular

- DOLCE claims to be an ontology of particulars
- @chatgpt thinks [[prdct.gfo]] might have better concrete/abstract distinction;  

## Mixins

- UFO has 'em
- 

## Space

### The Gauntlet

- [[the-gauntlet]] is a fictional trade route through space  connecting [[Anchorpoint-Station]] and [[the-Frontier]]

#### DOLCE

- classes: #SpaceRegion and #PhysicalPlace 
- properties: #connects

#### GFO

- claims to use Brentano space, but #Space_time is disjoint with #Abstract !
- 

#### SUMO

- has #Path and #Route
- #startsAt and #endsAt

#### gUFO
