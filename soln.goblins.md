- [[p.description]] Spritely is a project to level up the federated [[social web|t.comm.social-media]]. It builds on our experience from co-authoring [[ActivityPub|soln.activitypub]], the largest decentralized social network on the web to date, while applying lesser known but powerful ideas from the [[object capability security community|t.cs.security.object-capability-model]].
