## Description

General Ontological Language (GOL) is intended to be a formal framework for building and
representing ontologies. The main purpose of GOL is to provide a library of formalized and
axiomatized top-level ontologies which can be used as a framework for building more specific
ontologies. The GOL-Framework consists of three components representing different levels of
abstraction. Meta-GOL contains basic principles of semantic choice, a general view on categories
and classes, methods of semantic transformations, and principles for meta-logical analyses. GOL-
Software tools contain a number of systems which support the development, the evaluation, the
mapping and the integration of ontologies, but also application software (Onco-Workstation,
Onto-Builder, SOP-Creator) based on ontological principles.
GOL on the object level consists of a basic logic and a representation language RGOL which is
specified, in this version of the document, by a syntax whereas the semantics has not been com-
pletely developed yet. RGOL has a built-in ontology which is called abstract core ontology, de-
noted by ACO. ACO contains the basic entities categories, including the category of concrete
entities, and classes, and as relations identity, membership and instantiation; we believe that
ACO is an indispensable part of every top-level ontology. The core of GOL is intended to be a
library of top-level ontologies which extend ACO. The first of these ontologies, which is called
General Formal Ontology (GFO)
