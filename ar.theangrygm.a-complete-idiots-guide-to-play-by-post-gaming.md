## Highlights

### No Dynamic Exchanges

- because of the slow and asynchronous nature of the game, you need to avoid back-and-forth exchanges. It’s kind of like the difference between a debate and a negotiation.
  - In a negotiation, there are a lot of low-content messages flitting back and forth. Negotiation is basically two people firing proposals and counter-proposals at each other over and over again until they hit one they both agree on. Messages are short and there are lots of them.  ^3i9ekyfm2c0l
  - Contrast that with a structured debate. There’s a single talking point and each participant then delivers a speech about the topic. When they’re done, the next participant gets to deliver their own speech responding to the previous one. Then the first participant responds. And then topic is closed and a new one begins. You thus end up with small number of high-content messages. ^n4877p2jlmwz
- There are lots of little fiddly bits like that in D&D that would make it hard to cut out the negotiational nature of action resolution. There’s lots of shit on the character sheet that interrupts and affects action resolution at various stages. Everything from, “After you roll the die, you can…” to “As a reaction, when a creature…” Not to mention all the fiddly little buffs and debuffs and conditions people can give each other.

## It's Bigger Than You Think

- Real, actual conversation is a rapid-fire slew of low-content messages and so are the best social interaction scenes in tabletop roleplaying games.
- By necessity, I can’t imagine playing a naturalistic conversation in a PbP game just because it’d take a week and there is a limit on patience and pacing even for a low-commitment activity. There comes a point where every human gets bored with being trapped in the same scene for four days.
- you’ve got to accept that things like conversations are going to play out very differently so, for example, conversations are going to be more like each characters taking turns delivering speeches and you have to play into that with how you narrate shit or you’ve got to do a mix of both. I would probably land on doing both. I’d definitely shy away from naturalistic conversation and combat both 


## Thoughts

- running combat by post seems horrible!
