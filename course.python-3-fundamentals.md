## 2. Running Python

- python is both a compiler (to bytecode) and interpreter 
- 

## 3. Python Basics

- floats are objects; shouldn't be compared, but they're faster and smaller than decimal
  - have as_integer_ratio method
- format() function allows you to specify decimal points
- abs() is absolute value
- entities have state (data) and methods (functionality)
  - "The method operates the data in the class, while a function is used to return or pass the data. A function can be directly called by its name, while a method can't be called by its name."
- immutable objects: integers, decimals, floats
- variables 
  - must start with underscore or letter
  - standard use snake case and lowercase
