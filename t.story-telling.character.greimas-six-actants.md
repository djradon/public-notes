Algirdas Julien Greimas, a Lithuanian-French semiotician, developed a theory of narrative structure known as the **"actantial model,"** which is a tool for analyzing the roles that characters and elements play in a story. Greimas proposed that there are six fundamental "actants" that can be identified in any narrative. These actants are not specific characters but rather functional roles that characters or entities can occupy within a narrative structure.

### The Six Actants:

1. **Subject**:
   - **Role**: The primary character or entity that drives the action of the story, often the protagonist.
   - **Goal**: The subject seeks to achieve something, typically represented by the "object."
   - **Example**: In a hero’s journey, the hero is the subject.

2. **Object**:
   - **Role**: The goal or desired outcome that the subject is striving to obtain or achieve.
   - **Example**: In a quest narrative, the object might be a magical artifact that the hero seeks.

3. **Sender**:
   - **Role**: The entity or force that sends the subject on the quest or assigns the task.
   - **Example**: In many fairy tales, the king who sends the hero on a quest is the sender.

4. **Receiver**:
   - **Role**: The entity that benefits from the subject’s success; often the same as the subject but can also be another character or group.
   - **Example**: If the hero is retrieving a stolen treasure, the original owner of the treasure could be the receiver.

5. **Helper**:
   - **Role**: Characters, forces, or tools that assist the subject in achieving the object.
   - **Example**: In many stories, the helper could be a sidekick, a magical creature, or even a weapon that aids the hero.

6. **Opponent** (also referred to as "Antagonist"):
   - **Role**: The character, force, or obstacle that opposes the subject and creates conflict.
   - **Example**: The villain or antagonist in a story who tries to prevent the hero from achieving the object.

### Actantial Model Structure:
These six actants can be visualized as occupying different positions in a narrative structure:

- **Subject → Object**: The subject is striving to achieve or obtain the object.
- **Sender → Receiver**: The sender motivates or compels the subject to pursue the object, ultimately for the benefit of the receiver.
- **Helper → Opponent**: The helper assists the subject, while the opponent tries to hinder the subject.

### Application in Narrative Analysis:
Greimas’ actantial model can be applied to a wide range of narratives, from simple fairy tales to complex modern stories. By identifying the actants in a story, analysts can better understand the underlying structure and the roles that different characters and elements play.

### Example in a Classic Tale:
In the story of **"Little Red Riding Hood"**:
- **Subject**: Little Red Riding Hood.
- **Object**: Delivering the basket of food to her grandmother.
- **Sender**: Little Red Riding Hood's mother.
- **Receiver**: The grandmother.
- **Helper**: The woodsman who saves her.
- **Opponent**: The Big Bad Wolf.

This model helps in breaking down the narrative into its functional components, making it easier to analyze the dynamics of storytelling.
