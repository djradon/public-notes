## Highlights

- The TLO provides the modelling framework for all the data instances that makes up the Reference Data and, as a result, the Reference Data provides the framework for all the data instances that are generated during the information system's operations. 
- Reference Data can be thought of as a library of permitted classes that define what systems are concerned with and should rarely (if ever) change once created
  - continuous additions are allowed
- Master Data can be considered as an important subset of IO Data that needs to be accessible to many/all participating systems
