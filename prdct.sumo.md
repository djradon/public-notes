- similar: [[prdct.milo]]

## Implementations

- [[prdct.grammatical-framework]] see https://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/116606.pdf
  - The representation of SUMO in GF preserves the expressivity of the original ontology, adding to this the advantages of a type system and built-in support for natural language generation.

## Comparisons

### vs Cyc

- the only product truly comparable to SUMO in terms of size, scope and degree of formal definition is [[prdct.cyc]]

### WordNet

- [[prdct.wordnet]] is lexical

### Dolce

- [[prdct.dolce]] uses classes and properties in the service of describing particulars and has a set of metaproperties that aren't defined in DOLCE itself

### BFO

- [[prdct.basic-formal-ontology]] - limited in scope

### OWL

- "a logical language with a simplistic upper ontology"
