## Implementations

- [[prdct.grammatical-framework]] see https://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/116606.pdf
  - The representation of SUMO in GF preserves the expressivity of the original ontology, adding to this the advantages of a type system and built-in support for natural language generation.

- the only product truly comparable to SUMO in terms of size, scope and degree of formal definition is [[prdct.cyc]]

### BFO
