## Takeaways

- Chatbots provide a new, incredibly addictive form of entertainment.
- We are still grappling with what it means to purchase emotions.
- The attention economy still reigns supreme.

## Conclusion

Whatever the root cause, loneliness is a real problem, and chatbots may offer a temporary salve. Still, that so much of my research pointed to signs of user addiction and a preference for chatbots over humans is cause for concern. A world where humans depend on AI for emotional connection is probably not a better one.
