- likely many definitions, but I like TypeDB's:
  - [[p.hasSource]] [[Modelling Data with Hypergraphs|ar.medium.modelling-data-with-hypergraphs]]
    - a hypergraph consists of a non-empty set of vertices and a set of hyperedges;
    - a hyperedge is a finite set of vertices (distinguishable by specific roles they play in that hyperedge);
    - a hyperedge is also a vertex itself and can be connected by other hyperedges.
