## t.2024.08.16.10

- [x] regarding [[prdct.ontogen]], is it at odds with keeping history (of events, relator validity) in the dataset? i.e., RDF immutability or event-driven/relator-based RDF 
  - see [[pub.question-log.2024.08.16.ontogen-vs-relator-based-rdf]]
  - graph-based versioning might be orthogonal to an immutable-ish data store (in text files, in git)
  - t.2024.08.16.15: ultimately, no... ontogen seems mostly concerned with commit history, not validity or application time. its speech acts are the acts of data stewards more than application users
