## [[p.begsQuestion]]

- Any way to expose to unlimited users for free?
  - t.2024.05.08.16 yes, with desktop, "Export diagrams to 100% self-contained HTML files that can be hosted anywhere."

## Concrete vs Abstract models

- Concrete diagramming models are bottom-up, fact-based models that prioritize hard information over generalizations.
- Abstract resources are intangible and purely conceptual. Their very existence has an eye-of-the-beholder quality to it. From computing, abstract resources include things like services and domains. 
  - e.g. Order Service and User Service (rendered in green) are the abstract resources. These services exist only conceptually; they are nothing more than a convenient way of grouping APIs, Lambdas and database tables. Like concrete resources in the previous section, they can be used to demonstrate higher-level relations and interactions
