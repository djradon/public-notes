## Abstract

successful fictional characters become paramount examples of the ‘real’ human condition because they live in an incomplete world that we have cognitive access to but cannot influence in any way and where no deeds can be undone. Unlike all the other semiotic objects, which are culturally subject to revisions, and perhaps only similar to mathematical entities, the fictual characters will never change and will remain the actors of what they did once and forever
