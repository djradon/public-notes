## Abstract

- We design a temporal description logic, TQL, that extends the standard ontology language OWL 2 QL, provides basic means for temporal conceptual modelling and ensures first-order rewritability of conjunctive queries for suitably defined data instances with validity time.

## Highlights

- [[prdct.owl.ql]] does not support temporal conceptual modelling and, rather surprisingly, no attempt has yet been made to lift ontology-based data (obda) acces based on query rewriting to temporal ontologies and data
