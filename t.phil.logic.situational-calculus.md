- "McCarthy first introduced Situational Calculus [46, 48]. It concerns situations, actions and fluents in a dynamic domain. Actions make the domain change from one situation to another. Fluents are situation-dependent functions for describing the effects of actions. In 4D Fluents model, fluents are properties that change over time [73]. These properties are special cases in that both the domain and range of them are temporal parts of the corresponding entities. " ^vmhpi7mrf12z
