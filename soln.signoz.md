- "[[Prometheus|soln.prometheus]] is good if you want to do just metrics. But if you want to have a seamless experience between metrics and traces, then current experience of stitching together Prometheus & Jaeger is not great. Grafana is making some efforts in this direction with Trace viewer - but we think this is just stitching 2 disparate systems."
