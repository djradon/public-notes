    - This system is housed in a small plastic box (about 2′ x 2′ x 1′) with a series of filters inside and a low powered pump after the filters. The filters require manual cleaning. When they clog greywater can’t flow through them and it instead flows to the sewer/septic. The filtered greywater from this system isn’t clean enough for a drip irrigation system, it can be used with 1/4 inch outlets, or additional the system can include additional filters (not part of the Aqua2Use system) for smaller drip emitters. Users report problems with the pump and other technical difficulties, like the float switch getting hung up inside the box and burning out pump.

    - [[p.hasHighlight]] “In most cases, people are watering too much anyway, so one day a week is very doable and will probably be better for everybody, including the plants,” Savio says. “My neighbor used to come home and sprinkle her garden every night. She did it for her benefit because it was relaxing, but her plants had roots that were barely an inch into the soil. Her watering satisfied them each night, but when the 100-degree heat came all her plants were dead because there had been no system for their roots to grow deeper. Consequently, they literally fried in the soil.”
