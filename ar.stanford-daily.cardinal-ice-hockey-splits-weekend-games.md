This past weekend, the Stanford ice hockey
team faced off against two Utah teams at
home, winning the first game against Weber
State by a score of 8-5 but losing the second to
Utah State 7-5. With the previous weekend's
victories over UCLA and USC, the Cardinal
record now stands at 3-1.
Stanford dictated play in the first game,
hosted Friday night on the Cardinal's home
ice at Ice Oasis in Redwood City. Weber State
did not present much of a challenge to Stan
ford's offensive abilities, but it did provide a
physical challenge to the Cardinal constitu
tion.
"Put simply, they were a dirty team," said
winger Brian Browder. "They were all hack,
slash, trip, clutch and grab. They play a very

old-school Canadian brand of hockey, and it
helped them compensate for a lack of defen
sive ability."
By way of contrast, the Cardinal faced a
much more talented team on Saturday night.
After jockeying for position the whole game,
Stanford found itself down by one goal in the
closing minutes of the third period. Coach
Ernie Ferrari tried the classic strategy of
pulling the goaltender with one minute left in
the game, but the extra player seemed to con
fuse the team more than it added to its offen
sive puissance. In the remaining seconds of
the match, Utah State scored on an empty net
to clinch the victory.
"I don't like to lose," Ferrari said, "but that
game was a good learning experience for us.
Utah State is the kind of fast-skating, high
caliber team that Stanford is going to have to

continue to play as we generate more atten
tion across the nation."
One decidedly negative outcome of the
weekend series was an injury to Cardinal
defenseman Matt Blythe. With a stress frac
ture to his left shin, Blythe only managed to
play a part of the second contest, and that
against his doctor's orders.
"Matt is a key member of the defensive
corps," said teammate Kevin Weitske. "Our
other guys are good, but not so good they can
play without him. We can try to convert one of
our versatile centers to compensate, but
they'll never have Matt's good-natured ebul
lience."
With or without Blythe, the ice hockey
team will host traditionally competitive
Northern Arizona State this Friday evening in
the Lumberjacks' season opener.
