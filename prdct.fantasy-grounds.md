## Features

measuring distance is a single right click and pick a pointer(line, square, circle) you wish to measure with. Or you can just target the creature you wish to attack and it will give you distance. Advantage, disadvantage, cover, etc, etc. Are automatic if the DM knows how to apply statuses, that's a click and drag onto the token btw. There is a grid and it's very easy to set. Literally a click and drag to size lol. Loading the active map is as easy as double clicking on the token on your character sheet. Should I go on? 


## User Stories

### Foundry is unmatched in its user interface. FG is unmatched in its automation. 

### better DM prep time 

 Fantasy Grounds is still much easier on the DM for prep time. With one of the published adventures I can literally run a game with zero preparation beforehand. I wouldn't say it's a great idea, but it can be done. That isn't possible in Foundry. Imported adventures (see below) in Foundry are a long way from the plug-and-play Fantasy Grounds set up.

The automation in Foundry is actually very limited without community-built-modules. And those modules can be a pain-in-the-butt to get set up and play nice. Fantasy Grounds has the automation built in and doesn't require maintaining a dozen, or more, modules to keep that working. 

###  chatbox is just cluttered. 

The format of text and everything it likes to throw in there forces me to sit here and squint every time something happens to figure out the actual result. 

### data is mine

- "Knowing that all my stuff will be mine as long as I want it even if Smiteworks goes bankrupt, and that WotC doesn't have the legal right to revoke my access was huge. Roll20 can cancel your account and you lose all your content. FG is immune to that thanks to the contract language they have. "
