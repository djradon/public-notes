## Inspiration

We believe that the dereferencing layer has to be independent from the SPARQL endpoint implementation so during these last years we preferred using [[prdct.pubby]] to other software for publishing our data. Probably you don't know this, but you already know Pubby, it is used to publish DBpedia data and a lot of other Linked Open Data out there. Sadly, it is pretty old and its development appears to have stopped, so we created LodView taking inspiration from some of the features in it we really appreciated.
