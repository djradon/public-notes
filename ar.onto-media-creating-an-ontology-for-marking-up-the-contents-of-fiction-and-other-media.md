#### ABC Ontology

- [[prdct.abc-ontology]]
- The strength and weakness of this approach was that it tried to describe everything using the same basic structures and had its roots in factual events outside the document. [^1]
  - While the ontology can be used to describe the events that occurred within the document it was “designed to model physical, digital and analogue objects held in libraries, archives, and museums and on the Internet” [5]. Where it goes beyond the physical it focuses on “abstract concepts such as intellectual content and temporal entities such as performance or lifecycle events that happen to an object” [5].
- With the OntoMedia model we were concerned not only with the facts but also the possibilities and concepts that existed behind those facts.
