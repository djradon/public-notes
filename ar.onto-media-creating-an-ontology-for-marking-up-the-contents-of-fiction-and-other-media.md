#### ABC Ontology

- [[prdct.abc-ontology]]
- The strength and weakness of this approach was that it tried to describe everything using the same basic structures and had its roots in factual events outside the document. [^1]
  - While the ontology can be used to describe the events that occurred within the document it was “designed to model physical, digital and analogue objects held in libraries, archives, and museums and on the Internet” [5]. Where it goes beyond the physical it focuses on “abstract concepts such as intellectual content and temporal entities such as performance or lifecycle events that happen to an object” [5].
- With the OntoMedia model we were concerned not only with the facts but also the possibilities and concepts that existed behind those facts. 
  - The ABC model includes the ‘abstraction category’ as a way of expressing ideas which do not exist in the context of a situation but sees this primarily as a way of binding together various manifestations of the same intellectual expression. 
  - Conversely the OntoMedia structure deals primarily with abstractions that exist behind the content. While, like the ABC model, our struc- ture was based on the concepts of entities and events we specifically focus on the needs of best describing content of both analogue and multimedia. 
  - In this way the OntoMedia ontology can be integrated with the ABC model if required but otherwise provides augmentation and an alternative method of interfacing with the expression of that content while allowing other models to describe the relationship between that expression and the physical media that contains it as well as the bibliographic information that relates to either the expression or the physical media
