## Description

- ' if you believe that simplicity beats the “sexy" complexity introduced by heavy JS frameworks like React, Vue, Angular, etc; if you’re a single developer/small team wanting to productively churn out simple, easy to understand code that doesn’t require a bunch of extra build steps; if you buy into philosophies like the idea behind Tailwind CSS, Alpine.js and yes some parts of Hotwire (especially the “html over the wire” part), then I suggest you at least try out htmx before you make a decision.'
