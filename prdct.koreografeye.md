## Description

- Koreografeye is a choreography / orchestration engine for linked data services using [[prdct.notation3]] (N3) rule engines such as [[prdct.eye]].

Koreografeye was created to facilitate automated processes against Solid pods. Our main use case is monitoring the LDN Inbox of [[prdct.solid]] Pods for new notifications and running scripts when new data arrives.
