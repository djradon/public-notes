## Highlights

- there should be metadata about your dataset

### Four rules



    Use URIs as names for things

    Use HTTP URIs so that people can look up those names.

    When someone looks up a URI, provide useful information, using the standards (RDF*, SPARQL)

    Include links to other URIs. so that they can discover more things.
