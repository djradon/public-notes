## Four Main (Data-Driven) Types [2]

- [[p.attributedTo]] @Martin-Gerlach et al 

-   **Average:** The most common type are people who are high in neuroticism and extraversion while lower in openness.
-   **Reserved:** People in this type are not open or neurotic but they are emotionally stable. They tend to be introverted, agreeable and conscientious.
-   **Role-models:** These people are natural leaders with low levels of neuroticism and high levels of agreeableness, extraversion, openness and conscientiousness. They listen to new ideas and are reliable.
-   **Self-centered:** While these people score high in extraversion they rank below average openness, agreeableness and conscientiousness.
