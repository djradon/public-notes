## new application (dave)

On the other hand, if we could just get file watching working on the inclusion folders, then you could work there, have everything ready to commit if you wanted, and it'd be better for the workflow where you wouldn't have to copy changed files from _combined back to the sources. But a watcher implies changing my approach from an extension of Lume to a separate stand-alone application. Which isn't a bad idea... it could be useful for other SSGs too. 

## new application (chatgpt)

Switching to a standalone application for file watching and handling repository inclusions is a solid idea, especially if you want to expand its utility beyond Lume and make it more adaptable for different workflows or SSGs. Here's a structured approach to think through this shift:

---

### Advantages of a Standalone Application

1. **Improved Workflow**:
   - Developers can work directly in the inclusion folders, with changes automatically reflected in `_combined` or equivalent directories.

2. **SSG-Agnostic**:
   - Makes the tool usable across multiple SSGs, fostering broader adoption and reusability.

3. **More Focused Features**:
   - Separates the responsibilities of file management and SSG configuration, making both systems cleaner and more maintainable.

4. **Watch and Sync**:
   - A watcher can automatically detect changes in inclusion folders and copy them to `_combined`, avoiding manual tidying or copying.

---

### Key Features for the Standalone Application

1. **File Watching**:
   - Monitor changes in inclusion folders.
   - Trigger syncing of modified files to `_combined`.

2. **Sync Logic**:
   - Use the current `copyIncludedPaths` logic as the basis for syncing, ensuring includes, excludes, and path transformations are respected.

3. **Options Configuration**:
   - Maintain a config file (`_multisourceConfig.json` or `.ts`) for:
     - Inclusion paths
     - Exclude rules
     - Sync behaviors
     - Repository handling

4. **SSG Trigger**:
   - Optionally trigger the SSG build process upon detected changes.

5. **Dev Mode**:
   - Support a "dev mode" where syncing is disabled, and users can work directly in `_combined`.

6. **Commit Helper**:
   - Include a CLI option to assist in committing changes back to the inclusion folders.

---

### Proposed Architecture

#### 1. **File Watcher**:
   - Use `Deno.watchFs()` to monitor inclusion directories.
   - Handle events like `modify`, `create`, and `remove`.

#### 2. **Sync Engine**:
   - Sync modified files to `_combined` using a refined version of `copyIncludedPaths`.

#### 3. **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**:
   - Commands for:
     - Starting the watcher
     - Running a one-time sync
     - Committing changes back to repositories

#### 4. **Configurable Behavior**:
   - Allow global and per-inclusion options, such as:
     - Whether to sync automatically.
     - Include/exclude rules.
     - Triggering the SSG.

#### 5. **Integration with SSGs**:
   - Provide hooks for common SSGs like Lume, Eleventy, Hugo, or Jekyll.
   - Optionally build `_combined` directly into the SSG's source folder.

---

### Workflow Example

1. **Start the Watcher**:
   - Run the standalone tool, e.g., `multisource --watch`.
   - Monitors specified inclusion folders.

2. **Work Directly in Inclusion Folders**:
   - Modify files in the source repositories (e.g., `repo/demo/file.txt`).
   - The tool detects changes and copies `file.txt` to `_combined`.

3. **Trigger SSG**:
   - Automatically or manually trigger the SSG to rebuild the site.

4. **Commit Changes**:
   - Use the tool’s commit helper to push changes back to the source repositories.

---

### Challenges and Considerations

1. **File Syncing**:
   - Ensure that syncing is efficient and avoids unnecessary copies.

2. **Conflict Resolution**:
   - Handle cases where `_combined` and inclusion folders diverge.

3. **Dependency Handling**:
   - Ensure the tool remains lightweight and doesn’t introduce unnecessary complexity for SSG users.

4. **SSG Agnosticism**:
   - Design the tool to integrate seamlessly with multiple SSGs without hardcoding behavior for any specific one.

---

### First Steps for Development

1. **Create a Prototype**:
   - Focus on file watching (`Deno.watchFs`) and syncing as a proof of concept.

2. **Extract Existing Logic**:
   - Reuse the current repository handling and copying logic, adapting it to the standalone context.

3. **CLI Framework**:
   - Use a CLI framework like `Cliffy` to handle user commands and options.

4. **Integration Points**:
   - Start with Lume integration as the primary use case, then expand to others.

---

Would you like help sketching out a prototype or focusing on specific parts of this standalone approach?

## name

You said:
 It's a CLI app, (so I would use Cliffy). For a name, it's basically a combiner, we could call it combiner-cli. Any ideas for a more memorable name? Combines are a type of farm equipment, a harvester, maybe a play on that.

 Here are some refined suggestions that capture the idea of selectivity, productivity, and bringing something new to life—more aligned with creation and transformation than destruction:

---

### Creation and Transformation Themes
1. **Cultivate**  
   - Emphasizes nurturing, growth, and careful selection, fitting the idea of combining and creating.

## launch.json vs deno tasks

### **1. Should `launch.json` Refer to Deno Tasks?**

Yes, **`launch.json`** can refer to Deno tasks, but it doesn’t have to. It depends on how you want to configure your debugging workflow:

- **Directly Using Deno Tasks in `launch.json`**:
   - Pros:
     - Leverages the predefined commands in `deno.json`.
     - Keeps your `launch.json` simpler.
   - Cons:
     - Limited flexibility in passing additional arguments dynamically unless the task itself is configured to handle them.

- **Using `launch.json` Independently**:
   - Pros:
     - Full flexibility to define arguments directly in the debugging configuration.
   - Cons:
     - Duplicates task definitions already present in `deno.json`.

### Example of Using a Task in `launch.json`
Here’s how you can call a Deno task in `launch.json`:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "type": "deno",
      "request": "launch",
      "name": "Run Weave Task",
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/deno.json",
      "args": ["task", "start"]
    }
  ]
}
```

This runs the `start` task from `deno.json`.

---

### **2. Can Deno Tasks Take Command-Line Arguments?**

Deno tasks **cannot directly accept command-line arguments**, but you can work around this by defining multiple tasks or using environment variables. If dynamic arguments are essential, you’ll likely need to pass them in `launch.json` directly.

#### **Workarounds**
1. **Environment Variables**:
   - Pass arguments via environment variables in `deno.json`:
     ```json
     {
       "tasks": {
         "start": "MY_ARG=value deno run --allow-read src/cli/weave.ts"
       }
     }
     ```
   - Access `Deno.env.get("MY_ARG")` in your code.

2. **Custom Tasks for Common Scenarios**:
   - Define tasks for specific use cases:
     ```json
     {
       "tasks": {
         "monitor": "deno run --allow-read src/cli/weave.ts monitor",
         "sync": "deno run --allow-read src/cli/weave.ts sync"
       }
     }
     ```

3. **Passing Arguments Dynamically in `launch.json`**:
   - Instead of relying on `deno.json`, define `launch.json` configurations for specific tasks with arguments:
     ```json
     {
       "version": "0.2.0",
       "configurations": [
         {
           "type": "deno",
           "request": "launch",
           "name": "Monitor Mode",
           "program": "${workspaceFolder}/src/cli/weave.ts",
           "args": ["monitor"]
         },
         {
           "type": "deno",
           "request": "launch",
           "name": "Sync Mode",
           "program": "${workspaceFolder}/src/cli/weave.ts",
           "args": ["sync"]
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

---

### **Recommendation**

- Use **`launch.json` independently** if you need to frequently pass dynamic arguments or switch commands.
- Use **tasks in `deno.json`** for repetitive commands with fixed parameters.

Would you like me to set up sample configurations for either `launch.json` or `deno.json`?

## context summary

Here’s a concise summary you can use to start a new chat about **Weave** in the **o1-mini** repository:

---

**Weave Project Context Summary**:
- **Weave** is a dynamic CLI tool for remixing static sites, focused on syncing, monitoring, and managing files from multiple inclusion sources. 
- It integrates file watching, repository handling, and dynamic workflows to empower static site generation.
- It's output is a folder (named "_weave" by default) that blends different sources (git repos, local folders, remote files) based on inclusion rules
- While running in "monitor" mode, will watch local folders (including repo folders) detect changes in any local sources, and copy them to the output folder where they can be picked up by a static site generator
- The project follows a modular structure inspired by Lume, with:
  - A `src/cli` directory for CLI-specific logic (`cli.ts` as the entry point).
  - A `src/util` directory for core utilities like repository management, file syncing, and configuration handling.
  - A `deps` folder for centralized dependency management, similar to Lume's approach.
- **Planned Features**:
  - Dynamic configuration reloading during runtime.
  - Modular utilities for syncing, monitoring, and conflict resolution.
  - A future interactive mode for real-time adjustments and task prioritization.

## existing software that is similar to weave

There are tools and software that share some similarities with **Weave**, but none that combine its exact focus on **remixing static sites** by dynamically syncing, monitoring, and managing inclusions from multiple sources. Here’s an overview of related software categories and tools:

---

### **1. Static Site Generators (SSGs)**
**How They Compare**:  
SSGs like Lume, Jekyll, Hugo, and Eleventy focus on transforming source files into static websites, but they don’t typically handle multi-repository inclusions or advanced syncing out-of-the-box.

- **Lume** (Deno-based SSG):
  - **Similarities**: Deno-powered, extensible with plugins, integrates file watching for live rebuilds.
  - **Differences**: Lume is purely an SSG and doesn’t offer repository inclusion or advanced file syncing like Weave.

- **Eleventy**:
  - **Similarities**: Highly flexible, allows for customization of input/output workflows.
  - **Differences**: Repository and file inclusion is not its primary focus.

---

### **2. File Synchronization Tools**
**How They Compare**:  
Tools like `rsync` or Unison focus on syncing files between directories or systems but lack the higher-level logic of inclusion/exclusion rules, configuration reloading, and SSG integration.

- **rsync**:
  - **Similarities**: Efficient syncing of files and directories.
  - **Differences**: No project-specific context or dynamic configuration for SSG workflows.

- **Unison**:
  - **Similarities**: Handles bidirectional syncing with fine-grained control.
  - **Differences**: Focuses on syncing rather than managing or combining multi-repository inclusions.

---

### **3. Multi-Repository Management Tools**
**How They Compare**:  
Tools like Git submodules, git-subrepo, or monorepo management tools (e.g., Nx, Lerna) help manage multiple repositories but don’t focus on combining file outputs dynamically for static site generation.

- **Git Submodules/Subrepo**:
  - **Similarities**: Handle dependencies across multiple repositories.
  - **Differences**: No support for live syncing or inclusion/exclusion logic.

- **Nx** or **Lerna**:
  - **Similarities**: Useful in monorepo setups for managing dependencies and shared codebases.
  - **Differences**: Geared towards JavaScript/TypeScript projects, not static site workflows.

---

### **4. Site Content Aggregators**
**How They Compare**:  
Some tools aggregate content from various sources for publishing but are either more narrowly focused or tightly coupled with specific ecosystems.

- **Netlify CMS**:
  - **Similarities**: Allows managing content from multiple sources for static site workflows.
  - **Differences**: Primarily focused on headless CMS features, lacks syncing and repository inclusion logic.

- **Gatsby Source Plugins**:
  - **Similarities**: Pull content from multiple sources (e.g., APIs, markdown files).
  - **Differences**: Requires a specific Gatsby project setup, not flexible for general-purpose remixing.

---

### **5. File Watching and Build Tools**
**How They Compare**:  
Tools like Webpack, Parcel, or Deno’s `watchFs()` are designed for file watching and transformations but don’t handle multi-repo inclusion or static site workflows.

- **Deno’s File Watching (`watchFs`)**:
  - **Similarities**: Provides low-level file watching for live rebuilds.
  - **Differences**: Requires custom logic for syncing or combining files.

---

### **Unique Aspects of Weave**
1. **Multi-Source Inclusions**:
   - Combines files from multiple repositories or directories dynamically.
   - Handles include/exclude rules with reloading capabilities.

2. **Dynamic Development for Static Sites**:
   - Integrates with SSG workflows without being tied to a specific SSG.

3. **Focus on Remixing**:
   - Goes beyond syncing to enable creative combinations of resources.

---

### Is Weave a Unique Offering?
Yes, **Weave** fills a niche by combining the features of:
- File synchronization (like `rsync` or Unison),
- Multi-repository management (like Git submodules),
- Static site workflows (like Lume or Hugo),
- And live file watching (like Webpack or Parcel).

If you’d like, I can help analyze specific tools or explore how Weave might integrate with or enhance existing workflows!
