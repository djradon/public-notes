- #javascript has traits with symbol:
  - "Recent versions of JavaScript (i.e. ECMAScript 6) added a new primitive data type, symbol, which can be used to implement traits effectively. A symbol is basically a unique identifier that can be used as a property and that will never collide with anything else... The standard calls this feature protocol."
