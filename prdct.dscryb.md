- Send us an email and there is an extremely good chance that weâ€™ll grant you permission to reproduce or narrate a scene or scenes, for free, in your publication or broadcast. Same goes with playing Michael Ghelfi Studios & dScryb's original music, ambiences, and sound effects from the Sonic Library. Typically, all we ask is that you provide your audience with attribution of the content to dScryb, including our URL.
