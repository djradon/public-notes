## Highlights

I think KG viz today is dissapointing because:

    (1) they mostly using circles and lines
    (2) the layout algorithms (radial, circular, force-directed, etc.) are unaware of what the edges and node types mean
    (3) they don't have a way to downsample (when rendering a large graph) while preserving the spirit of the meaning of the data
