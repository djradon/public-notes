## Features

-   coherent integration of objects and processes (based on a novel category of _persistants_)
-   time and space entities as entities sui generis, and the relation of _coincidence_
-   a category of _situoids_, comprehensible wholes of the most independent character
-   elaborate accounts of functions and roles
-   openness regarding philosophical positions such as realism, conceptualism, or nominalism by the provision of different kinds of categories as universals, concepts, or symbolic structures
-   levels of reality and ontological regions
-   three-layered meta-ontological architecture consisting of an abstract top level, an abstract core level, and a basic level.

## Philosophy

- It turns out that a top-level ontology being used as a monolithic system is not flexible enough to be easily adopted for particular application areas. Therefore, in the continued development of GFO we pursue a novel approach, organizing the ontology into modules related to ontological regions and their levels.
- the evolution of foundational ontologies is based on two primary stages of revision, (i) the integration stage and (ii) the expansion and reorganization stage. In the integration stage existing foundational ontologies are compared, interrela- tions between them are studied and ontological mappings between them are established. The expansion and reorganization step consists in the inclusion of new insights from science, society, and nature, and in the creation of new corresponding categories that cannot be reconstructed within the given systems. We call this type of knowledge dynamics the community-driven creative evolution of ontologies

## Details

- GFO distinguishes four modes of being, which are associated with the following ontological regions of the world: the region of ma- terial entities, the mental-psychological ontological region, the social region (involving socio-systemic entities), and the region of ideal entities, where the latter includes mathematical entities, idealizations, and ideas.
-  trichotomy of processes, continuants and presentials. The latter can roughly be seen as snapshots of continuants at time points. The trichotomy comes with an integration law
