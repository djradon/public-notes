## Issues

- aren't "material processes" and "social processes" still processes?
- fine line between categories and attributives
  - "Categories provide the basic structure of the ontology, defining what kinds of things exist, whereas attributives are used to describe specific qualities or features of these things."
- 

## OWL

There is an OWL version of GFO, which currently comprises a stable core called gfo-basic.owl and a more extensive version called gfo.owl. The stable URLs to the current releases of these files are:

    http://www.onto-med.de/ontologies/gfo-basic.owl

    (version 1.0, build 13, 07.10.2008)
    http://www.onto-med.de/ontologies/gfo.owl

    (version 1.0, build 9, 28.08.2006)


## Features

-   coherent integration of objects and processes (based on a novel category of _persistants_)
-   time and space entities as entities sui generis, and the relation of _coincidence_
-   a category of _situoids_, comprehensible wholes of the most independent character
-   elaborate accounts of functions and roles
-   openness regarding philosophical positions such as realism, conceptualism, or nominalism by the provision of different kinds of categories as universals, concepts, or symbolic structures
-   levels of reality and ontological regions
-   three-layered meta-ontological architecture consisting of an abstract top level, an abstract core level, and a basic level.



## Concepts, Symbol Structures, and Platonic and Immanent Universals

- @gemini.1.5.advanced GFO accounts for different philosophical stances: It accommodates those who believe in the real existence of universals outside of minds (realism), those who view them as primarily mental (conceptualism), and those who emphasize representations (nominalism).
