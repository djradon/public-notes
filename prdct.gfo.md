(heterarchy with multiple inheritance)

## Features

-   coherent integration of objects and processes (based on a novel category of _persistants_)
-   time and space entities as entities sui generis, and the relation of _coincidence_
-   a category of _situoids_, comprehensible wholes of the most independent character
-   elaborate accounts of functions and roles
-   openness regarding philosophical positions such as realism, conceptualism, or nominalism by the provision of different kinds of categories as universals, concepts, or symbolic structures
-   levels of reality and ontological regions
-   three-layered meta-ontological architecture consisting of an abstract top level, an abstract core level, and a basic level.

## Philosophy

- It turns out that a top-level ontology being used as a monolithic system is not flexible enough to be easily adopted for particular application areas. Therefore, in the continued development of GFO we pursue a novel approach, organizing the ontology into modules related to ontological regions and their levels.
- the evolution of foundational ontologies is based on two primary stages of revision, (i) the integration stage and (ii) the expansion and reorganization stage. In the integration stage existing foundational ontologies are compared, interrela- tions between them are studied and ontological mappings between them are established. The expansion and reorganization step consists in the inclusion of new insights from science, society, and nature, and in the creation of new corresponding categories that cannot be reconstructed within the given systems. We call this type of knowledge dynamics the community-driven creative evolution of ontologies

## Details

- GFO distinguishes four modes of being, which are associated with the following ontological regions of the world: the region of ma- terial entities, the mental-psychological ontological region, the social region (involving socio-systemic entities), and the region of ideal entities, where the latter includes mathematical entities, idealizations, and ideas.
-  trichotomy of processes, continuants and presentials. The latter [presentials] can roughly be seen as snapshots of continuants at time points. The trichotomy comes with an integration law.
-  distinct notions of process and event: Processes form a central category of time-extended, immutable (can't change, but can contain changes) entities in GFO, whereas any event is relative to a process
- GFO provides a basic classification (ontology) of categories, whereas the notion of category covers all abstract entities that can be instantiated by or are predicated of other entities

### Space and Time

- Space and time are considered as categories, the instances of which are stipulated to be concrete individuals
  - Time comprises (a.o.) instances called chronoids, which may be understood as closely similar to real-valued intervals with endpoints. 
  - The category Space, called phenomenal space, exhibits space regions as instances of primary importance.

### Concrete Individuals

- there is a difference between a process boundary and a material structure. A material structure, being a snapshot / presential of a material object, contains only those qualities of the object that do not depend on a process. If we consider a moving ball B, then the presential of B at t contains qualities, such as its size, form, color, and mass. The process of the movement of the ball, restricted to a time point t, yields a process boundary that contains further qualities besides those mentioned, including the velocity and acceleration of the object at this time point.
- processes can never be wholly present at time points, whereas presentials possess this propert
- Processes form a subclass of processual complexes, which are the most general kind of concrete individuals that have a temporal extension. The temporal extension of a processual complex is a mereological sum of a non-empty set of chronoids. Cohesive processes form an important subclass of all processes: a process is cohesive if any two process boundaries are causally connected, if their temporal boundaries coincide
- Events are temporally localized at time boundaries. 
  - Another(?) type of event is a discrete change, for example, switching on the light in a dark room (understood to happen instantaneously
  - Histories present a further type of occurrents in that they form a sequence of process boundaries, for example, the sequence of measurements of blood pressure during a certain time interval. They play an important role in the investigation of time series
- Material situations are parts of the material world (at the macroscopic level) that can be consistently comprehended as a whole.
  -  We distinguish three kinds of situations: object situations, presentic situations, and situoids. 
     -  Object situations consist of material objects and relations between them. 
     -  A presentic situation is a snapshot of an object situation
     -  a situoid (or processual situation) is a part of the spatiotemporal world that arises from an object situation if all objects are replaced by the corresponding processes
        -  An example of a situoid is a football match, happening in time, and including all necessary participating entities, among them the players, the football, the goals and other entities, but also the localization and the corresponding environment(?)

### Complexity and Structure of Individuals

- One type of composition uses dependency relations that glue entities together, another
uses the part-of relation and the construction of mereological sums
  - Elementary individuals that are related to other individuals by some kind of dependency relation are called attributives. They include, among others, qualities, relators, roles, functions, dispositions, and structural features
  - Material objects are wholes consisting of bundles of attributives; furthermore, relational material facts are composed of material objects and relators, and material situations are composed of material facts. 
- for "We are aware of the problems related to bundle-theory. We agree essentially with the criticism by Gustav Bergmann [1967]" see [[sh.question-log.2024.03.12#what-are-gustav-bergmanns-criticisms-of-bundle-theory]]
- "An ontology of attributives contributes to an ontology of data because most data should be understood as the result of
measurements of attributives. "
- "A presentic object attributive is determined fully and as a whole by the object it inheres in and a time during which it exists. For example, an individual color of red inhering in some object can be wholly accessed at time points. "
  - "a presentic object attributive thus gives rise to a continuant, on the one hand, which itself exhibits, at each time point of its lifetime, a wholly present attributive at that time (a presential)"
- Non-presentic object attributives inhere likewise in objects, but they require something in addition to just their bearer and a time point. For example, the age of an object at a certain point in time is not only determined by that object and that very time point, but it requires something else; say, the initial point in time of the objectâ€™s existence. 
- "Besides, note that the composition of an object with some of its qualities yields more complex entities, called object facts."
- "Processual attributives have processes and process boundaries as bearers and they are classified into
presentic and global attributives."
  - Presentic processual attributives are associated with process boundaries; they must be wholly accessible at time points. The isolated presentic data of process boundaries do not need any reference to a process; they can be completely reduced to object qualities. These are typical qualities of objects that participate in the process. An example of a non-isolated presentic attributive of a process is the velocity of a moving body at a time point (even if it is zero, e.g. as an initial velocity). The velocity cannot be determined and specified without a temporally extended process
  - "The global attributives of processes present the richest class of attributives of processes. A systematic classification of these attributives is in its initial stage. Their main feature is that it is not meaningful to specify or refer to them at a process boundary. One type of global attributives is abstracted from time se- ries in the form of diagrams (such as curve diagrams). Examples are electro-cardiograms and long-term blood pressure measurements"
  - " Additionally, we emphasize that intrinsic global attributives of processes are themselves processes, called attributive processes. A clear separation between an attributive process and a corresponding bearer-process needs further investigation and clarification. A water wave, for ex- ample, can be considered as an attributive process that occurs on the basic process of local movements of water particles. This basic process is the bearer of the wave"
  - " Finally for processual attributives, many
other global attributives of a process are not derived from time series. Examples are the duration of a
process and its occupied space. Physics provides many examples of this kind, for example the average
velocity of a moving body. Further investigation of the global attributives of processes should take the
distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic attributives into account."
