## Features

-   coherent integration of objects and processes (based on a novel category of _persistants_)
-   time and space entities as entities sui generis, and the relation of _coincidence_
-   a category of _situoids_, comprehensible wholes of the most independent character
-   elaborate accounts of functions and roles
-   openness regarding philosophical positions such as realism, conceptualism, or nominalism by the provision of different kinds of categories as universals, concepts, or symbolic structures
