Hey djradon!

How’s your world coming along?

Now you’re set up with the basics, take your next steps in world creation.

Luckily, we’ve prepared a toolkit with everything you need to create, share and monetize rich, immersive worlds for gaming or fiction, in one secure place.

(You might want to save this email, in case you need to come back to it later.)
Create an immersive, interactive world.

📃 [Articles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKEXqz5kd1A&list=PLmurZz9emqGn53_DnqfI6GQrmfl-6LT0u&index=3) in World Anvil are the building blocks of your world. Start with one of 25+ templates designed to inspire you with prompts that give depth to your lore. They make writing articles for important people, places, and things in your world easy!

➡️ Pro tip: Start with elements from your [Worldbuilding Meta](https://blog.worldanvil.com/worldanvil/tutorials/how-to-start-worldbuilding-with-the-worldbuilding-meta/) - especially the Scene, People, and Drama sections!

🗺️ [Maps](https://blog.worldanvil.com/worldanvil/tutorials/how-to-create-your-world-by-setting-up-your-map/) in World Anvil can be linked to worldbuilding Articles, or other Maps. You can drill down from your world map all the way to the dungeon your party is crawling. Your players or readers can explore your world like never before!

➡️ Pro tip: Did you know you can create your own custom markers on maps?

⏳ [Timelines](https://blog.worldanvil.com/worldanvil/tutorials/how-to-start-worldbuilding-history-with-timelines/) help you keep your story straight (or circular, if your players or characters create a time loop paradox…) Track party or character history separately from the larger world and display your lore chronologically.

➡️ Pro tip: Timelines are great to start, but Chronicles are what you need to make the biggest impact to your players and readers!
Keeps you organized, motivated, and inspired.

🗂️ [Categories](https://blog.worldanvil.com/worldanvil/tutorials/how-to-organize-worldbuilding-with-categories-getting-started-with-world-anvil/) form your world’s table of contents, and organize your world! Think of them like folders that sort and store your Articles.

➡️ Pro tip: Keep each category under 20 articles. It will make finding what you need much faster and will allow you to quickly order everything inside them

With friendly monthly Challenges, weekly Streams featuring expert advice, and hundreds of worldbuilding Prompts, you’ll never run out of ideas again.
Share it with others, but keep your secrets safe.

🕮 Manuscripts, 👨‍💻 Subscribers and 🤫 Secrets are tools for pro novelists and GMs. They allow you to share work with your readers or players - but ONLY the parts you want them to see, and WHEN you want them to see.

➡️ Pro tip: Guild member tools like these are available when you’re ready to take your world to the next level.
🤯 Overwhelmed? We’ve got you.

World Anvil is BIG… because World Anvil is a complete toolkit! But you don’t have to use every tool. Start with only what you need.

Go to Features to enable (or disable) tools.
