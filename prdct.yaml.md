## Features

- "YAML 1.2 is a valid superset of JSON"

## Comparison

### vs [[prdct.json]]

  - @chatgpt.3.5: " you can create structures in YAML that help organize data in a way that resembles namespaces or scopes in other systems."

## Issues

- YAML lacks protections from corrupted YAML files. [^1]
