In addition to "instants" (but should've been called intervals) and "local times" (which are really the same, but just displayed in the user's time zone), Glocal time is like "midnight on New Years", it's not a single instant, but a set of ahowever-many-time-zones instants. Or "sunrise" is actually an infinite number of instants.![](/assets/images/2024-02-07-21-32-38.png)
