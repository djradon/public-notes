## Terms

### Work

### Expression

- "There are many ways a work can be expressed, and it can be difficult to determine what constitutes a separate expression, and what is a new work entirely; cataloger judgment is required. In general, translations, revisions, versions, illustrated editions, abridgements, and illustrated editions would be considered unique expressions of the same work." [^1]
- In D&D, each edition has its own expression of spells, items, classes, etc.
- In-world, each setting? has its own version of these thing? Or each ruleset.

## Manifestation

- In D&D, could a manifestation be [[prdct.roll20]]'s version of a thing vs [[prdct.one_dnd]]? That's oow
- in-world, 
  - in a place without mass-production, unique items have a single manifestation. But perhaps in a bespoke workshop, a certain well-honed process could lead to a manifestation of an object with multiple corresponding items?
