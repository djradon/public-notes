## Terms

### Work

- analagous to Platonic Form

### Expression

- "There are many ways a work can be expressed, and it can be difficult to determine what constitutes a separate expression, and what is a new work entirely; cataloger judgment is required. In general, translations, revisions, versions, illustrated editions, abridgements, and illustrated editions would be considered unique expressions of the same work." [^1]
- In D&D, each edition has its own expression of spells, items, classes, etc.
- In-world, each setting? has its own version of these thing? Or each ruleset.

### Manifestation

- In D&D, could a manifestation be [[prdct.roll20]]'s version of a thing vs [[prdct.one_dnd]]? That's oow
- in-world, 
  - in a place without mass-production, unique items have a single manifestation. But perhaps in a bespoke workshop, a certain well-honed process could lead to a manifestation of an object with multiple corresponding items? 
  - or maybe groups of things that don't have distinct identities 

### Item

## Issues

- 'Despite initial positive assessments of FRBR clarifying the thoughts around the conceptual underpinnings of works, there has been later disagreement about what the Group 1 entities actually mean.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_Requirements_for_Bibliographic_Records#cite_note-5) The distinction between Works and Expressions is also unclear in many cases.'
- [[Resources That Refer Vs Resources That Are|vs.resources-that-refer-vs-resources-that-are]]
- [[idea.instances-are-sometimes-classes]]
- a group of concrete things: set of items? or manifestation
