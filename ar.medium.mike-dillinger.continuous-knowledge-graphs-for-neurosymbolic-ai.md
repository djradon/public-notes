  - yes, continuous and discrete are often arbitrary... it's a continuous spectrum
  - distributions are important!
    - e.g. [EuropeanMales haveHeight (Œº=180cm, ùúé=7cm)]
  - Graph Neural Networks contribute a range of important techniques in this conversion to continuous-format knowledge graphs.
  - Continuous knowledge graphs with entities and relations defined and matched along continuous dimensions as well as triples that have properties and grounding measured on continuous scales are a natural fit for mathematical and probabilistic modeling. And an exciting next step to take us beyond the straitjacket of two-valued logic and binary variables that people mistakenly associate with non-numeric knowledge.
