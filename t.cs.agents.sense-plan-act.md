  - "For robots whose ultimate mission is to complete tasks, only variables that are relevant to successful completion should be estimated. I propose to initially only track a minimal set of directly-relevant variables (attention), and gradually increase the sophistication of models on-demand (refinement), in a local fashion. This estimator refinement process is triggered by violations in expectations of task success (mismatch)"
