## Concepts

### Fluent

- a function or a predicate that varies over time, and is used to describe the effects of actions

### Events

- represent changes performed over time
- In the EC, the terms Actions and Events are interchangeable
- Davidsonâ€™s theory defines action as a particular subclass of event that is endowed with intentionality.
