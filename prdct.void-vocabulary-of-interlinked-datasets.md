## Features

- Links are sometimes published as part of a larger dataset. For example, many of the resources described in the DBpedia dataset are linked via owl:sameAs to other datasets. In other cases, [[linksets|t.cs.web.w3c.rdf.linkset]] are handled as stand-alone sets of triples, independently from either of the two linked datasets. For example, link generation tools such as Silk [SILK] can discover new links between two existing datasets. Both cases—linksets published as part of a larger dataset, and linksets that are independent from the linked datasets—can be described in VoID.
