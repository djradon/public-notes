## Description

Main aspects in which DOLCE+DnS Ultralite departs from DOLCE Lite-Plus are the following:

- The names of classes and relations have been made more intuitive - The DnS-related part is closer to the newer 'constructive DnS' ontology (http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/cdns/cDnS.owl). - Temporal and spatial relations are simplified - Axiomatization makes use of simpler constructs than DOLCE Lite-Plus - The architecture of the ontology is pattern-based, which means that DOLCE+DnS Ultralite is also available in modules, called 'content ontology design patterns', which can be applied independently in the design of domain ontologies (cf. http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org). If many modules are needes in a same ontology project, is anyway useful to use this integrated version.
