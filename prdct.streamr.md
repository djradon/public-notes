  - "Usually when you design solutions with MQTT you have stream named like this: application_name/device_id/temperature it means, for the device 1234 in the application tempApp: tempApp/1234/temperature. MQTT allows a dynamic creation of flows. With StreamR it seems complicated to have a such dynamic creation. Flows definition is static. The CLI allow to dynamically create flow, so it can be automated but not free... stream creation cost has been 0.016 MATIC ( about $0.01 )"
