## @janet-singer

Hybrid systems are multi-paradigm systems that could be seen as combinations of data-driven or bottom up and theory-driven or top-down . But ‘Neuro-symbolic’ is unclear by itself: ‘Neuro’ is metaphoric, and contrasting ANNs with ‘symbolic’ is misleading because all IT involves rule-based symbol manipulation
