## Mood

- "Greenwood has stated that his own version of the Forgotten Realms, as run in his personal campaign, is much darker than published versions."

## Lore

- "When Gary Gygax "lost control of TSR in 1985, the company saw an opportunity to move beyond Greyhawk and introduce a new default setting". In 1986, TSR began looking for a new campaign setting for AD&D, and assigned Jeff Grubb to find out more about the setting used by Greenwood as portrayed in his articles in Dragon.

According to Greenwood, Grubb asked him "Do you just make this stuff up as you go, or do you really have a huge campaign world?"; Greenwood answered "yes" to both questions."[1]
