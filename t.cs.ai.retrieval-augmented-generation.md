## RAG helps bridge the gap for Small Language Models (SLMs)

- While SLMs inherently manage other key aspects such as language generation and understanding, RAG equips them to perform comparably to their larger counterparts by enhancing their knowledge base.
- This makes RAG a critical equalizer in the realm of AI language models, allowing smaller models to function with the robustness of a full-scale LLM.

## Structured Output in Evaluation Frameworks

- "As the field of Retrieval Augmented Generation continues to evolve, the adoption of structured output in evaluation frameworks will play a crucial role in advancing the state of the art."
