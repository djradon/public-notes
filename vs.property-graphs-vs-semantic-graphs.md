property graphs support key-value pairs

- [[p.hasComparand]]
  - [[t.cs.graph.semantic-graph]]
  - [[Property Graph|t.cs.graph.property-graph]]

## thoughts

- [when semantic graphs support reification, aren't they essentially the same?][1]
  - maybe, and I think predicates are adequate to represent key-value pairs on
    - subjects/objects (aka "things" or, in graph theory, [[gd.concepts.nodes]])
