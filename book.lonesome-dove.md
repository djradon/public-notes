## Highlights

### Pigs Walking

  “Why, they’re the first pigs to walk all the way from Texas to Montana,” Augustus said. “That’s quite a feat for a pig.” 

  “What will it get them?” Call inquired. “Eaten by a bear if they ain’t careful, or eaten by us if they are. They’ve had a long walk for nothing.”

  “Yes, and the same’s likely true for us,” Augustus said, irritated that his friend wasn’t more appreciative of pigs.
