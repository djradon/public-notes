## Pros

### you could host on github pages, in a limited way:

There's nothing special about the HTTP requests that HTMX makes. So you can have it request resources hosted on GH pages, but those can't change based on previous Interactions, they are static.

Which means you could either fake a backend for demonstration purposes or you could have preplanned interactions, like in Choose Your Own Adventure books.

#### get directions from a queue

- choose your own adventure, but the event hub tells you where to go. new files can be uploaded for just-in-time scenario generation

## Cons

- https://kentondejong.medium.com/sorry-im-not-diggin-htmx-cc28df862910 mentions a bunch of stuff, just being picky I think.
