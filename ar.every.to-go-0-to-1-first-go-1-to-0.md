## Highlights

- "-1 to 0 is when you figure out what you want to work on. It’s when you decide where to allocate the next 5-10 years of your life."
- "-1 to 0 is about founder-market fit. Figure out what you want to build and why you are the right person to build it before you start."
- conviction/proof points: the thing you build, the story you tell about the problem it solves, and why you are the right person to build that solution
  - "Weakness in any of these proof points makes it harder to convince the constituencies whose belief you need in the early stages—customers, recruits, investors, yourself. The less proof you have, the more likely that you are stuck in a local maximum. You might have built a product that 100 users love with no larger market opportunity, or found a market opening without a potential product solution, or lack the founder-market fit to survive the company-building gauntlet."
- -1 to 0 isn’t a break or a stage you should rush. You only get a few shots at building your life’s work—so make them count.
