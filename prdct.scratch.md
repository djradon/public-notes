## [[c.Idea]]

- "If Scratch 4 ever rolls around, the Scratch Team should absolutely base it on a Javascript-based Smalltalk, one with a live visual environment like Squeak has. This would bring back everything I loved about the 1.x versions of Scratch and their pedagogical value while maintaining Scratch 3's support for phones and tablets."
