- [[p.hasCon]] additional complexity/indirection/traversal
  - boo hoo
- [[p.hasTopic]] [[t.cs.graph.]]
- rdf-style semantic graphs (with triple, quads, and maybe-mores) share the misfortunate but understandable mistake of representing the verb or property type as an arc
- [[c.resource]] ["I think the only mistake you could make is to use the term "arc" for undirected graph."](https://math.stackexchange.com/q/1441525)
- some relationships are undirected; deal with it
