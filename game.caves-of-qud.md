## Descriptions

- "Qud is a roguelike in the full "descendant of Rogue" meaning; a game you're expected to start and re-start and re-play different permutations of, similar to the family tree of games that gets us to Slay the Spire and Hades, though Qud is a throwback to an older branch of that tree."
