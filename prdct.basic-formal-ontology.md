- entity
  - continuant: exists through time, i.e. "three-dimensionalist"
    - independent continuant: doesn't require a bearer, e.g. 
      - material entity
        - object
        - fiat object part: arm (it's not an object b/c it reflects decision)
        - object aggregate
      - immaterial entity
        - site (e.g. holes)
        - continuant fiat boundary
          - fiat point (zero-d)
          - fiat line (1d)
          - fiat surface (2d)
        - spatial region
          - 0d, 1d, 2d, and 3d
    - generically dependent continuant
    - specifically dependent continuant
      - qualities: not realizable (like redness)
      - realizable entity: a potential, or function, like the ability of a phone to make phone calls
        - role
        - disposition
          - function
  - occurrent
    - process
    - process boundary
    - temporal regional
    - spatiotemporal region

## Attributes

- **realist**: all classes have (or had) instances in space and time
  - fictional world ontologies are built by mimicking existing BFO-conformant ontologies"
- **backbone taxonomy + lateral relations** : 
## [BFO2 Reference](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BFO-ontology/BFO/master/docs/bfo2-reference/BFO2-Reference.pdf)

- We use ‘category’ to refer to those universals at the most general and domain-neutral level. BFO treats only of categories in this sense. A category is a formal (= domain-neutral) universal, as contrasted with the material (domain-specific) universals represented in one or other domain ontology. BFO:fiat object part is a category in this sense; not however organism or weapon, or mortgage contract. Spatial, temporal and spatiotemporal region terms are counted as representing formal universals in this sense, since they apply in all domains.

- specifically dependent continuants are subject to the axiom of non-migration – they cannot migrate from one bearer to another. Generically dependent continuants, in contrast, can in a sense migrate, namely through a process of exact copying which allows, for example, the very same information artifact to be saved to multiple storage devices.
