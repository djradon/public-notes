## [BFO2 Reference](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BFO-ontology/BFO/master/docs/bfo2-reference/BFO2-Reference.pdf)

- We use ‘category’ to refer to those universals at the most general and domain-neutral level. BFO treats only
of categories in this sense. A category is a formal (= domain-neutral) universal, as contrasted with the
material (domain-specific) universals represented in one or other domain ontology. BFO:fiat object part is
a category in this sense; not however organism or weapon, or mortgage contract. Spatial, temporal and
spatiotemporal region terms are counted as representing formal universals in this sense, since they apply in
all domains.
