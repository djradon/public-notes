## [[c.Feature]]

- unlike semantic networks, they allow for exceptions in particular instances. This gives frames an amount of flexibility that allows representations of real-world phenomena to be reflected more accurately.

-  a semantic classification is applied to an utterance based upon recognizable templates of syntax parse trees and morphological lexicon, with word-sense ambiguity resolved by context and world-knowledge. You can think of this classification as akin to a large collection of "dialog acts" that capture the general gist of the utterance meaning.
