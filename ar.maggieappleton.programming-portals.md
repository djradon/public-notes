### Theoretical Framework

> The theoretical groundwork for why this kind of dynamic, interactive medium is critical to the future of interfaces has been well-trodden by [Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com/). In pieces like [Learnable Programming](http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/) and [Drawing Dynamic Visualizations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef2jpjTEB5U) Bret outlines a series of principles that make programmatic systems learnable. Such as being able to **read the vocabulary** of a programme, **see the state**, and **create by reacting** to what's on the screen in front of you.
