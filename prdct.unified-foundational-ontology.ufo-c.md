- "UFO-C [ 24] differentiates between Agents and Objects as subtypes of Substantial Individuals. Agents are Agentive Substantial Individuals that are classified as Physical Agents (e.g., a person) or Social Agents. Objects are Non-agentive Substantial Individuals that are classified as Physical Objects (e.g., a car) and Social Objects, like languages or norms. A Normative Description defines one or more rules acknowledged by at least one Social Agent, like organizations or communities. A Plan Description is a specialization of a Normative Description that describes Complex Action Universals (such as Processes). Action Universals are Event Universals (Perdurants) as described in UFO-B. Intentional Moments reside in Agents, and can be mental or social. Intentions are Mental Moments, and prompt the Agent to perform Actions, which can be complex or atomic. Social Moments are types of Intentional Moments that are generated by Social Actions."
