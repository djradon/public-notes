## Features

- developer-friendly, API-driven approach that using JSON

## Issues

- "Where I could see OpenMetadata improving is moving towards developing more features aimed at data lineage. Weâ€™re seeing a lot of awesome lineage work being done by OpenLineage and DataHub." (as of 2021-10)
- "not yet as feature rich as Amundsen or DataHub, I am impressed with how OpenMetadata is taking a developer-friendly approach to the metadata store."
