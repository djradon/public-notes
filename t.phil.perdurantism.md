## Description

- Perdurantism is a philosophical theory of persistence and identity [34]. It is closely related to four dimensionalism. In 4D view, an object that persists through time has distinct temporal parts at every time instant during its existence in time. Each persisting object is considered a four dimensional spacetime worm that stretches across the space- time domain. Slicing the spacetime worm at a specific time instant or interval results a temporal part or time slice which manifests itself as entity-at-a-time.

## Issues

- counterintuitive

## Features

- helps to resolve a number of longstanding metaphysical conundrums relating to change over time.
- provides a very useful way of modelling vagueness
- able to meet several of the challenges raised against more traditional the- ories of time and change by the theory of special relativity (Effingham, 2012)
