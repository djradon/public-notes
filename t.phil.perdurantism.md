## Description

- Perdurantism is a philosophical theory of persistence and identity [34]. It is closely related to four dimensionalism. In 4D view, an object that persists through time has distinct temporal parts at every time instant during its existence in time. Each persisting object is considered a four dimensional spacetime worm that stretches across the space- time domain. Slicing the spacetime worm at a specific time instant or interval results a temporal part or time slice which manifests itself as entity-at-a-time.
