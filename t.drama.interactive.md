### role-playing vs interactive drama

#### a good contrast by claude

Role-playing and interactive drama are related but distinct concepts:

[[t.roleplaying]]:
- Participants assume the roles of characters
- Often more loosely structured
- Can be done for entertainment, education, or training
- May or may not have a predefined story or outcome
- Common in games, therapy, and educational settings

[[t.drama.interactive]]:
- A form of theater or performance art
- Audience members actively participate in the story
- Has a more defined narrative structure
- Often guided by professional actors or facilitators
- Typically aims for a specific artistic or educational goal

The main differences are:
1. Structure: Interactive drama usually has a more defined narrative, while role-playing can be more open-ended.
2. Purpose: Interactive drama is often focused on artistic or educational outcomes, while role-playing has a broader range of applications.
3. Guidance: Interactive drama is typically led by professionals, whereas role-playing can be more self-directed.
4. Setting: Interactive drama is often a public or semi-public performance, while role-playing can occur in more private or informal settings.
