## Zeebe vs Activit

[[prdct.zeebe]] and [[prdct.activiti]] are both popular open-source workflow and business process management (BPM) engines, but they cater to slightly different use cases and have distinct architectures and features.

### Zeebe:
1. **Architecture**:
   - **Microservices-Oriented**: Zeebe is designed with microservices in mind. It is a distributed, horizontally scalable workflow engine that can handle high throughput and large volumes of workflow instances.
   - **Event-Driven**: Zeebe is built for event-driven architectures, making it well-suited for modern cloud-native applications where workflows are triggered by events.

2. **Performance and Scalability**:
   - **High Throughput**: Zeebe is designed to scale horizontally, meaning it can handle a large number of workflow instances concurrently, making it ideal for high-traffic applications.
   - **Cloud-Native**: Zeebe is optimized for deployment in cloud environments like Kubernetes, where scalability and fault tolerance are critical.

3. **Target Use Cases**:
   - **Event-Driven Microservices**: Zeebe is particularly strong in scenarios where workflows need to be integrated into microservices architectures.
   - **Large-Scale Process Automation**: It’s ideal for applications that require processing thousands or millions of workflow instances.

4. **Supported By**:
   - Zeebe is developed and supported by Camunda as part of the Camunda Cloud platform, which also includes advanced features like monitoring and analytics.

### Activiti:
1. **Architecture**:
   - **Traditional BPMN Engine**: Activiti is a more traditional BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) workflow engine. It has a monolithic architecture, although it can be deployed in a microservices architecture.
   - **Java-Based**: Activiti is a lightweight BPMN engine built primarily in Java, making it easy to integrate with Java-based applications.

2. **Performance and Scalability**:
   - **Single Instance Deployment**: Activiti is designed for deployment in single-instance or clustered environments but doesn’t scale as naturally or horizontally as Zeebe.
   - **Good for Mid-Sized Workflows**: While it performs well for moderate workflow loads, Activiti may face limitations when dealing with very high-throughput environments.

3. **Target Use Cases**:
   - **Traditional BPMN Workflows**: Activiti is well-suited for organizations looking to implement standard BPMN workflows in enterprise applications.
   - **Integration with Java Applications**: Activiti integrates seamlessly with Java applications and is a good choice for Java-heavy environments.

4. **Supported By**:
   - Activiti was originally developed by Alfresco and is now maintained by the Activiti community. It has a large user base and many extensions available.

### Comparison Summary:
- **Zeebe**: Best for cloud-native, event-driven microservices architectures that require high scalability and throughput. It is the go-to option for modern, large-scale distributed systems.
- **Activiti**: Best for traditional BPMN-based workflows, particularly in Java-centric environments. It’s more suited for medium-scale workflows and enterprise applications that don’t require the scale and distribution capabilities of Zeebe.
