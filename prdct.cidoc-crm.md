## Highlights

-  In order to
understand the function of a formal ontology of this kind, one needs to make the following distinctions:
  - The material reality
  - The units of description or particulars, i.e. the things and relations which we refer to in order to distinguish parts of reality... What goes on in our minds or is produced by our minds is also regarded as part of the material reality, as it becomes materially evident to other people at least by our utterances, behaviour and products.
- A formal ontology, such as the CIDOC CRM, constitutes a controlled language for talking about particulars. I.e.,
it provides classes and properties for categorizing particulars as so-called “instances” in a way that their
individuation, unity and relevant properties are as unambiguous as possible.
- A KB does not represent a slice of reality, but the justified beliefs of its maintainers about that reality. For simplicity, we speak about a KB as representing some reality
  - t.2024.03.20.20:  everything should have attribution?
  - is it just as simple as "haha, in my use case, the knowledge base is the reality."?
