## Features

### Property Paths

@chatgpt: Property paths in SPARQL are a powerful feature that allows you to write queries that navigate through RDF graphs in more complex ways than simple triple patterns. Property paths can be used to traverse multiple relationships, specify optional or alternative paths, and query over arbitrary lengths of paths.

### Key Property Path Operators:

1. **Concatenation (`/`)**:
   - Specifies a sequence of properties.
   - Example: `:parent/:child` retrieves all grandchildren by following a `:parent` relationship and then a `:child` relationship.

2. **Alternatives (`|`)**:
   - Specifies a choice between properties.
   - Example: `:spouse|:partner` retrieves relationships where either `:spouse` or `:partner` applies.

3. **Zero or More (`*`)**:
   - Matches a property path of any length, including zero.
   - Example: `:ancestor*` finds any number of `:ancestor` relationships, including direct and indirect ancestors.

4. **One or More (`+`)**:
   - Matches a property path of at least one step.
   - Example: `:ancestor+` retrieves all direct and indirect ancestors, but not the individual itself.

5. **Zero or One (`?`)**:
   - Matches a property path of zero or one step.
   - Example: `:spouse?` retrieves relationships where the `:spouse` property exists or matches no property.

6. **Inverse (`^`)**:
   - Inverts the direction of the property.
   - Example: `^:parent` retrieves all entities that are children of a given individual.

### Examples of SPARQL Queries Using Property Paths:

#### 1. Find All Descendants:
```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/>

SELECT ?descendant WHERE {
  :John :parent+ ?descendant .
}
```
- **Explanation**: This query finds all descendants of `:John` by following the `:parent` property one or more times.

#### 2. Find Direct or Indirect Ancestors:
```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/>

SELECT ?ancestor WHERE {
  ?ancestor :parent* :John .
}
```
- **Explanation**: This query finds all direct or indirect ancestors of `:John`, including `:John` itself.

#### 3. Find Individuals Related by Spouse or Partner:
```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/>

SELECT ?related WHERE {
  :John (:spouse|:partner) ?related .
}
```
- **Explanation**: This query finds individuals related to `:John` by either the `:spouse` or `:partner` relationship.

#### 4. Query for Connections through Multiple Properties:
```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/>

SELECT ?person WHERE {
  :John (:knows/:friendOf) ?person .
}
```
- **Explanation**: This query finds all individuals who are friends of people that `:John` knows.
