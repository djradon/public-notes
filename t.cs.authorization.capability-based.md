desc: 'Often referred to as simply a ‘key,’ a capability is the single thing that both designates a resource and authorizes some kind of access to it. The capability is an unforgeable token of authority.'

## Description

- "In capability systems, a subject corresponds to an instance of a software component, such as an object (an instance of a class, as in a capability language) or a process (an instance of an executable program, as in a capability operating system)."
- "By tying access to key, rather than a centralized control system, Capability-based models push security to edge, decentralizing large attack vectors known as honeypots."
