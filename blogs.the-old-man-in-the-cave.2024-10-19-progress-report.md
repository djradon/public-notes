## Has it been two weeks already?

Actually, it’s been three weeks since my first [dev journal post](https://theoldmaninthecave.substack.com/p/lets-reboot-the-semantic-web-with-alternate-realities) and [ general article](https://djradon.substack.com/p/introducing-carpe-noctem).

Why so long? Writing those two articles left me a little dazed and daunted. Call it writer’s fatigue. I also wanted to get some technical work worth writing about under my belt. I’ve been going from minus one to zero for long enough already. 

So I made some progress on an [[unorthodox foundational ontology|ko]].  I'm calling it Kosmion. Anouncement forthcoming, maybe in a week or three. 

Progress might’ve been quicker but I’ve been deep in the gopher holes, including a stand-off with the [[“gentle” Unified Foundational Ontology|prdct.unified-foundational-ontology.gUFO]]; planning for a [[semantic static site generator|sflow]]; a review of [[t.cs.web.w3c.rdf.named-graphs]] and the [[w3c Data Catalog|prdct.dcat-data-catalog]] standard; and posting an article [surveying authoring tools for Semantic Web data](https://theoldmaninthecave.substack.com/p/whats-the-best-semantic-web-authoring).


## Moving Forward

I’d like this dev journal to be somewhat frequent and less engrossing (to write, that is). So I might have to rein in the rumination, lower my standards, and just crank out more updates and [[public learnings|t.edu.learning-in-public]], goddammit. I can save the over-polishing for my other blog, [[blogs.carpe-noctem]].

If you're curious about Kosmion, I’m posting chats with my tireless synthetic co-conspirator [[here|ko.conversations]].
