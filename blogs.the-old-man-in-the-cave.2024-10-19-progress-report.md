## Has it been two weeks already?

Actually, it’s been three weeks since my [first dev journal post](https://theoldmaninthecave.substack.com/p/lets-reboot-the-semantic-web-with-alternate-realities) and [first general article](https://djradon.substack.com/p/introducing-carpe-noctem).

Why so long? Those combined ~3500 words were so agonized that I’m still recovering. Also wanted to get some work worth writing about under my belt. I’ve been going from minus one to zero for long enough already. 

So I made some progress on a [[hot-shot foundational ontology|ko]], announcement forthcoming. Progress might’ve been quicker but I’ve been down many gopher holes, including planning for a [[semantic static site generator|sflow]], a review of the [[w3c Data Catalog|prdct.dcat-data-catalog]] standard, and an article surveying  authoring tools for Semantic Web data.


## Moving Forward

I’d like this dev journal to be somewhat frequent and less engrossing (to write, that is). So I might have to lower my standards and just crank out [[some public learnings|t.edu.learning-in-public]], goddammit. Judging from my ChatGPT history, there are more than enough topics to choose from. I can save the over-polishing for my other blog, [[blogs.carpe-noctem]].

If you're curious, I’m posting my ChatGPT summaries to [[ko.conversations]] and a [[false start with the ontology|ko.false-starts.2024-10-11]]. I'm calling it Kosmion.
