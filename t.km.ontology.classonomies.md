- "Classonomies consist of classes. Typically, a very large number of classes. The classes, while otherwise largely “undefined”, may be organized taxonomically using rdfs:subClassOf statements. By undefined, I mean classes that have no ontological definitions. Classes that do not define characteristics (i.e., properties) of their members. Instead, they have the kind of information one typically associates with instances e.g., synonyms, acronyms, various identifiers, descriptive text and, possibly, variety of other statements."
- "Thesauri are not expected to be semantically precise. They simply group broader and narrower topics."
-- **Rule #1 of the Ontology Development: If you can’t answer a question about what resources will be members of a class, you can’t create a class.**
- An obvious approach to turning such classonomies into thesauri is [[prdct.skos]]
