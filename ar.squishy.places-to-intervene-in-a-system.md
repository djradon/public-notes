## Highlights

- "We must not use the word system, then, to refer to an object. A system is an abstraction. It is not a special kind of thing, but a special way of looking at a thing." _(Christopher Alexander, 1968. [Systems Generating Systems](https://patterns.architexturez.net/doc/az-cf-173046))_
  - t.2024.11.19.06 depends on what you mean by object.
