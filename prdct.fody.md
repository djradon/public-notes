- #description An extensible tool for weaving .net assemblies. It enables the manipulation of the IL of an assembly as part of a build, which requires a significant amount of plumbing code. This plumbing code involves knowledge of both the MSBuild and Visual Studio APIs. Fody attempts to eliminate that plumbing code through an extensible add-in model. This technique is very powerful, for example you can turn simple properties into full INotifyPropertyChanged implementations, add checks for null arguments, add Method Timings, even make all your string comparisons case insensitive.
