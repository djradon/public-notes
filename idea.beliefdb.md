## Summary

- [we need] an annotation semantics that helps collaborating database users engage in a structured discussion on both content and each other's annotations. This creates several challenges for a DB that supports such annotations: (1) it needs to allow for conflicting beliefs: users should be able to use annotations to indicate conflicts between what they believe and what others believe. The DB should allow and expose those conflicts; (2) it must also support higher-order annotations: users should be able to not only annotate content but also other users' annotations
