## Description

### [[user.chatgpt.4o]]

**Collaborative storytelling** can take many forms, where participants work together to create a narrative. Some popular examples include:

1. **Tabletop RPGs** (e.g., **Dungeons & Dragons**): Players and a game master build a story through role-playing, with the plot evolving based on their decisions.
2. **Shared-world fiction**: Writers contribute stories set in a common universe (e.g., **Star Wars expanded universe**).
3. **Online role-playing communities**: In forums or platforms like **Discord**, participants write parts of a story collaboratively.
4. **Improv storytelling**: Groups use improv techniques to co-create stories live (e.g., improv theater).
