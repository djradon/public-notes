## Features

-   _Radigost_ is a purely web-based multi-agent platform, built using modern _HTML5_ technologies.
    
-   _Radigost_ agents and parts of the system itself are implemented in _JavaScript_ and executed inside the client's web browser.
    
-   The system is standards-compliant and interoperable, capable of interacting with third-party multi-agent solutions.
    
-   _Radigost_ is platform-independent, and supports a wide variety of hardware and software platforms.
    
-   Performance evaluation results demonstrate that the runtime performance of _Radigost_ is comparable to that of a desktop-based implementation.
