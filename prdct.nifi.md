## Comparison

### Nifi vs Airflow

-   **Language**: Airflow is built using Python, while NiFi is built using Java.
-   **Workflow Definition**: Airflow uses Python scripts to define workflows as DAGs, while NiFi relies on flow-based programming with a drag-and-drop interface.
-   **Data Processing**: Airflow focuses primarily on orchestrating data processing tasks, whereas NiFi is more focused on data movement, routing, and transformation.
-   **Scalability**: Airflow can be scaled horizontally with distributed task execution, while NiFi can scale out using its clustering feature.
-   **Ease of Use**: NiFi’s web-based interface is more user-friendly, especially for non-developers, compared to Airflow’s Python-based workflow definition.
