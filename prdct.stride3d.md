## [[c.Con]]

- no game-server / server-authoritative out of the box.

## [[p.vs]] [[prdct.Godot]]

- "Godot is just older and more established, but Stride has a better render engine, software architecture and is a pure .NET project. So the engine and the scripting use the same technology. Godot has a C++ core and only "interprets" the scripting languages, which is conceptually quite different."
