## Thoughts

- "distributed" means that the simulation is spread over multiple computer processes none of which have access to each otherâ€™s memory, and communicate via message passing using the [[Message Passing Interface|prdct.mpi4py]].

  - "the user must implement a save method that returns the state of the agent as a tuple."
    - hah! how about a reference to save state
  - event scheduling
    - "events are scheduled to occur at a particular tick. Ticks do not represent clock-time but rather the priority of its associated event"
    - A floating point tick, together with the ability to order the priority of events scheduled for the same tick, provides for flexible scheduling.
  - "components are of three types: 1) agents and their environments; 2) logging and data collection; and 3) simulation utility functions (e.g., random number management, input parameter parsing, and so on)"
