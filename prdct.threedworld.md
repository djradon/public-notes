## Description

- A TDW simulation consists of two components: a) the Build, a compiled executable running on the Unity3D Engine, which is responsible for image rendering, audio synthesis and physics simulations; and b) the Controller, an external Python interface to communicate with the build.

## Features

- "Every object in the model librarian has been semantically tagged by category: the wcategory and wnid parameters are the object's WordNet category and ID values."
- "In order to use keyboard and mouse controls, the TDW build window must be focused (i.e. be the selected window). This means that keyboard controls will only work on personal computers."
  - "When a key press or key hold occurs, Keyboard can either send a command to the controller, or trigger a function."
