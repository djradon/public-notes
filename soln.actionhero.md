  - "Actionhero includes a robust testing framework that works with Jest for testing JS and TS projects. "
  - allows you to build or add many types of servers into one application. Not only can you support HTTP and Web Socket, but you can add custom protocols like Quick and Protobuf to your application and easily reuse your Actions!
  - includes a REPL 
  - "not inherently 'RESTful' (which is meaningless for persistent socket connections) but can be extended to be so if you wish."
