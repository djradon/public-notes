Names are rarely random. Whether consciously chosen or shaped by tradition, they reflect the values, fears, and stories a society holds dear. What a culture chooses to give a name to, and how they choose to name it, can tell you just as much about them as their politics, architecture, or magic system.

Whether you're building a matriarchal seafaring empire or a tight-knit village in a forested glen, your naming conventions can say something powerful about how that world sees itself.
What Your Culture Prioritises

Names often reveal what a society celebrates or aspires to. For example:

    A militaristic society might favour names that reflect strength, like Talon, Stonehold, or Strongblade.

    A culture with deep spiritual traditions might name children after saints, seasons, or celestial bodies, such as Celeste, Moonstorm, Dance-of-Spring.

    An academic or arcane culture might lean toward long, multi-part names, with titles or syllables that signal mastery, like Kwenul Radiayth the II of the High Dynasty.

If a culture names people after animals, consider which creatures are respected and why. Are they named for predators, guardians, or clever survivors?

If a culture names people after natural phenomena, think about what those elements symbolise. A storm name might honour power or unpredictability, while a name linked to rivers or rainfall might suggest life-giving roles, adaptability, or calm persistence. Fire names could belong to warriors or passionate reformers.

These kind of associations aren’t just aesthetic, they reflect how the culture interprets the world around them and what traits they consider worthy of carrying into the next generation.
Tradition and Lineage

Naming can also reflect how a culture sees time. Some societies look backwards, honouring the past, anchoring themselves to ancestors and family lines. Others look forward, naming with hope for the future.

    Ancestral names: Children might be named after grandparents or important ancestors, either directly (Toren II) or through thematic echoes.

    Virtue names: Cultures that prize moral values may name children after ideals; Patience, Justice, Mercy, or their translated/invented forms.

    Mythic names: Some names might be drawn from folklore, legends, or creation stories, subtly keeping the culture’s mythos alive.

    Naming rites: A child might be unnamed until a certain age or after a ritual. The name itself might change throughout life based on deeds, titles, or spiritual revelations.

These traditions can be either a source of cultural pride or the cause of conflict. A character who refuses to name their child after an ancestor might be making a statement that leads to them facing deep disapproval or even exclusion.
Names You Shouldn’t Say

Every culture has its silences.

    Names that are taboo: perhaps the name of a fallen god, a cursed king, or a slain traitor.

    Names that are reserved: maybe only priests may speak them, or only in sacred spaces. They might be reserved for a particular social class, or specific lineage.

    Names that are forgotten on purpose: struck from history, buried by trauma or shame.

These absences are just as revealing as the names that are used. What your world doesn’t name, or refuses to name, is often loaded with meaning. Maybe there’s a mountain no one names. A city that once had a name, but it’s now only referred to as The Ashes.
Insider Names vs. Outsider Names

The names people use among themselves often differ from the names others use for them. This can create added layers of identity and perspective in your world:

    A desert-dwelling people might call themselves The People of the Wind, but outsiders refer to them as Sandwalkers.

    A noble house might use a formal dynastic name (House Ilveran), while locals just call them the Ironroots.

    A place might have a ceremonial name, a trade name, and a nickname depending on who’s speaking.

This is an active way that you can reveal the power dynamics in your world. Who gets to name who? Are certain names reclaimed? Is it offensive when outsiders use a shortened version of a sacred name?

Names can become weapons, whether they are used to make one person feel unwelcome and belittled, or used to dehumanise an entire populace.
How Names are Spoken and Shared

Even beyond meaning, the act of naming can reflect cultural behaviour. Are people expected to introduce themselves fully, or do they withhold their true names? Are names intimate, public, or sacred? Is a name something a person earns, rather than receives?

In some cultures, your name might change as you grow, reflecting your role, status, or accomplishments. In others, nicknames might be used more often than formal names, showing affection, teasing, or community belonging.

Think about what it means to know someone’s name in your world. Is it a sign of trust? Of danger? Of power?
Worldbuilding through Contrast

Sometimes the best way to highlight a culture’s values is by showing how different they are from another. In one kingdom, names might be bestowed by religious figures. In the neighbouring region, maybe names are chosen by the family matriarch.

One culture might emphasise individuality, giving unique names that are never reused. Another might have dozens of children sharing the same name, with importance placed on lineage instead. A colonising empire might impose its own naming system on the cultures it conquers, erasing native identities.

Names can be deeply political. They carry the weight of both identity and belonging, and sometimes, even resistance and rebellion.
Build from Within

As always, you don’t need to invent an entire naming culture up front. But even a few thoughtful touches, like why a name is passed down, or why someone refuses to say a certain name, can deepen your world instantly.

Start by asking:

    What do these people value?

    What do they fear?

    Who do they remember?

    Who do they want to become?

Names may feel like small things, but in fantasy worldbuilding, they’re loaded with meaning. A name can tell you everything from how a person was born, to who they’re meant to be, or how they view themselves.
