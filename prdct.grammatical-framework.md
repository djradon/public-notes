## Description

GF, Grammatical Framework, is a programming language for **multilingual grammar applications**. It is

-   a **special-purpose language for grammars**, like [YACC](http://dinosaur.compilertools.net/yacc/), [Bison](http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/), [Happy](http://www.haskell.org/happy/), [BNFC](http://bnfc.digitalgrammars.com/), but not restricted to programming languages
-   a **functional programming language**, like [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/), [Lisp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)), [OCaml](http://ocaml.org/), [SML](http://www.smlnj.org/), [Scheme](http://schemers.org/), but specialized to grammar writing
-   a **development platform for natural language grammars**, like [LKB](http://moin.delph-in.net/LkbTop), [XLE](http://www2.parc.com/isl/groups/nltt/xle/), [Regulus](http://www.issco.unige.ch/en/research/projects/regulus/news.shtml), but based on functional programming and type theory
-   a **categorial grammar formalism**, like [ACG](http://www.loria.fr/equipes/calligramme/acg/), [CCG](http://openccg.sourceforge.net/), but specialized for multilingual grammars,
-   a **logical framework**, like [Agda](http://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php), [Coq](http://coq.inria.fr/), [Isabelle](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/hvg/Isabelle/), but equipped with concrete syntax in addition to logic
-   a **platform for machine translation**, like [Moses](http://www.statmt.org/moses/), [Apertium](http://www.apertium.org/), but based on deep structural analysis (and usually applied for limited fragments of language).

 GF has an interactive command interpreter, as well as a batch compiler. Grammars can be compiled to parser and translator code in many different formats. These components can then be embedded in applications written in other programming languages. The formats currently supported are:

    Haskell
    Java, in particular the Android platform
    JavaScript
    Speech recognition: HTK/ATK, Nuance, JSGF
