- "I find the word  theologian  quite irregular. How many biologians, geologians or philologians do you know? Computational theology is very much concerned with preventing this kind of irregularity, which is so characteristic of natural language, from  spreading in computing systems, especially programming languages.  So I opted for the more regular expression, Computational Theologist."
