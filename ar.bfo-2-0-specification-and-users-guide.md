### The Monohierarchy Principle

- the asserted taxonomies of types and subtypes in BFO-conformant ontologies should be genuine trees (in the graph-theoretic sense), so that each node in the graph of universals should have at most one asserted is_a parent.
- This principle is of value not only because it supports a simple strategy for the formulation of definitions and thereby helps to prevent certain common kinds of error in ontology construction, but also because it brings technical benefits when ontologies are implemented computationally.
