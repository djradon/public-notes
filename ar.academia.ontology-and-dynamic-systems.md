## [[p.hasSummaryPoints]]

- The dominant ontology is "things have boundaries"
- a second ontology is "things are networked"
- a third ontology is "things have internal forces and may adapt to external changes"

## [[p.provokedThoughts]]

- I'm on the right track with the hyper-accounting of actions. 

## [[p.hasMemorableUtterance]]
  
- "Some rules may arise for trial randomly, as in in the form of ‘genetic algorithms’ that mimick therandom generation of new forms of life in the ‘crossover’ between chromosomesin the sexual reproduction of animals. They may, when succesful, grow to dominance. This dynamic ontology is redolent of previous ontologies of adaptiveforce, such as @nietzsche’s ‘will to power’."
