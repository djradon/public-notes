## Examples

            "Acid Arrow": {
                "content": [
                    "*2nd-level evocation*",
                    "**Casting Time:** 1 action",
                    "**Range:** 90 feet",
                    "**Components:** V, S, M (powdered rhubarb leaf and an adderâ€™s stomach)",
                    "**Duration:** Instantaneous",
                    "A shimmering green arrow streaks toward a target within range and bursts in a spray of acid. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 4d4 acid damage immediately and 2d4 acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a miss, the arrow splashes the target with acid for half as much of the initial damage and no damage at the end of its next turn.",
                    "***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage (both initial and later) increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 2nd."
                ]
            },
