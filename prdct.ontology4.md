## Interesting

### Dualism

- **Class-Attribute Dualism** has two approaches
  - 1. class has a property, and instances are members of class
    - e.g.: particularPerson is a Person, and has gender
  - 2. subclasses of a class have restrictions, and instances can be members of both classes
    - e.g.: particularPerson is a MalePerson and FemalePerson
  - "But only the second approach allows to model hermaphrodites by letting an instance >Instance-H1 be instance of the subclasses ^Class-F and ^Class-M at the same time. In the first approach, this can not be done, since then the attribute .Attribute-G would have to have the two values male AND female for >Instance-H1 like"
    - t.2024.06.06.09 but really? 

### 4 dimensions


    classes are represented by red ovals,
    relations are represented by dark blue octagons and
    activities are represented by yellow houses.
    instances are presented by green houses.

### Taxoverbies

- hierarchies of verbs/activities
- They parallel taxonomies as hierarchies of classes and mereologies as hierarchies of compositions/part-wholes.
