## Highlights

### Instantiating-Identifying Concept/Relationship (IIR)

In IIR models, a concept or relationship is reified and further temporalized. Either such relationship is abstracted as a new object, or a concept is viewed as four dimensional and instantiated to have temporal extents. Singleton Property converts each relationship to be universally unique. 4D fluents use concepts that view each resource as a perdurant. Fluents represent properties that change over time

#### Singleton Property

The formal semantics of the singleton property is derived from the standard RDF and RDFS semantics with the additional semantics extension for the vocabulary rdf:singletonPropertyOf. The singleton property gives rises to three cases of query patterns: data, metadata and mixed patterns which SPARQL supports. 

#### 4D Fluents

- Perdurantism is a philosophical theory of persistence and identity [34], and it is closely related to four dimensionalism. In the four dimensional view, an object that persists through time has distinct temporal parts at every time instant through its existence in time. Furthermore, each persisting object can be considered a four dimensional spacetime worm that stretches across space-time. Slicing the worm at a specific time interval or instant of the time dimension yields a temporal part.

- "OWL inverse operator and cardinality constraints are available and standard OWL reasoners can be used for inferencing."

#### Extended 4D Fluents 

- Batsakis et al. extended 4D Fluents model to incorporate qualitative temporal relations that have unknown temporal information... Semantics of the extended 4D Fluents model is based on the original 4D Fluents model, with the additional temporal semantics needed for qualitative temporal relations.

## Log

- t.2024.04.01.11: re-reading this on the plane, I'm amazed how much more helpful and concrete this seems now.
