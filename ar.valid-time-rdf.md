## Highlights

### Instantiating-Identifying Concept/Relationship (IIR)

In IIR models, a concept or relationship is reified and further temporalized. Either such relationship is abstracted as a new object, or a concept is viewed as four dimensional and instantiated to have temporal extents. Singleton Property converts each relationship to be universally unique. 4D fluents use concepts that view each resource as a perdurant. Fluents represent properties that change over time

#### Singleton Property

The formal semantics of the singleton property is derived from the standard RDF and RDFS
semantics with the additional semantics extension for the vocabulary rdf:singletonPropertyOf. The
singleton property gives rises to three cases of query patterns: data, metadata and mixed patterns
which SPARQL supports. 

#### 4D Fluents

- Perdurantism is a philosophical theory of persistence and identity [34], and it is closely related to four dimensionalism. In the four dimensional view, an object that persists through time has distinct temporal parts at every time instant through its existence in time. Furthermore, each persisting object can be considered a four dimensional spacetime worm that stretches across space-time. Slicing the worm at a specific time interval or instant of the time dimension yields a temporal part.
