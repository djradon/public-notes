## Features

-   **High-performance** - Cardinal is how a blockchain would be constructed if it was designed for games. It can handle thousands of game moves per second in real-time.
-   **Highly customizable** - Developers can write Cardinal plugins to introduce new features such as your own user scripting language, zero-knowledge proof systems, and more.
-   **Tick-driven runtime** - Cardinal utilizes the concept of ticks, commonly used in game server architecture, to allow developers to implement complex real-time game logic such as game physics, combat systems, and many more that are difficult to implement in an event-driven runtime of a typical blockchain.
-   **Easy integration with game engines** - Cardinal provides a simple, easy-to-use API and client libraries for game developers to integrate their game with popular game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine.
-   **Entity Component System** - Cardinal comes with native ECS architecture that allows game developers to easily manage and extend their game state and logic.
