## Commandments

-   Always Show the Goal

### IMMERSE PLAYERS IN THE GAME WORLD

This one’s simple – don’t throw too much game-iness at players... Build UI and metagame elements into the gameworld itself. Don’t insert a bunch of cutscenes.

Never remind players they’re just playing a game. You want them thinking it’s THEM in the world you’ve created, responding to things – causing things – that make sense to them in the context of your world.

There’s a reason I work in a genre called IMMERSIVE simulation.

#### and yet...

- D&D is immersive theater of the mind. Everything sensory is game-y.
- wandering around [[game.odyssey]] is fun, at least for me
