## [[c.Feature]]

- perfect choice for building multi-party video conferencing and real-time streaming apps.
- Instead of creating yet another opinionated server, mediasoup can be used as Node.js module or Rust crate which can be integrated into a larger application.
- comes with mediasoup-client (JavaScript library) and libmediasoupclient (C++ library) for building applications that run in any browser or device by using an unified API. Or just use well known software such as FFmpeg or GStreamer.
