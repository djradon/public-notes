- inventor of role-playing gaming
- “Why did it catch on so quickly? Because it offered almost pure escapism and the ability, in the game, to do anything and everything you wanted to do! Gads! Who wouldn’t get hooked on game playing nirvana like that after years of charts, tables, painting figures, etc.” ^y4ifwk0pc4o2
