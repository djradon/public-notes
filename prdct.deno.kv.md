## Features

- Deno KV is built for JavaScript and TypeScript. Store any JavaScript value, from strings to objects, without having to worry about 

## Cons

- " As a main data store, it doesn't feel powerful enough and I think there's a lot to consider in terms of data layout. For caching, I rather use Redis (or some flavor of Redis) - I find myself using sorted sets a lot so it's maybe out of commodity."
