- "By late 2020 this whole concept had attracted enough attention for the MIT Tech Review to write [a short piece](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/) on it. Perhaps this is the watershed moment when a Twitter buzzword has "made it."
