## Description

- allows engineers to directly specify their knowledge as ontologies with precise syntax and semantics, without the usual incidental complexity found in semantic web technologies and tools [^8]
- enabling systems engineers to consider rigor and agility across seven systems engineering architectural functions: representation, authoring, federation, configuration, integration, analysis, and reporting

## Features

- supports closed-world reasoning!? 
  - see [[pub.question-log.2024.08.20#how-does-opencaesaroml-support-closed-world-reasoning]]

## Concepts

- Vocabulary / Vocabulary bundle equivalent to ontology
  - but creating a vocabulary bundle "automatically asserts that classes in the bundled vocabularies that do not have common subtypes are disjoint (have no intersection), which helps detect a wide class of errors that would otherwise not get detected due to the open-world assumption" !?
- Description / Description bundle equivalent to instance data
