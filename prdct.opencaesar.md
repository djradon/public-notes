## Features

- supports closed-world reasoning!? 
  - see [[pub.question-log.2024.08.20#how-does-opencaesaroml-support-closed-world-reasoning]]

## Concepts

- Vocabulary / Vocabulary bundle equivalent to ontology
  - but creating a vocabulary bundle "automatically asserts that classes in the bundled vocabularies that do not have common subtypes are disjoint (have no intersection), which helps detect a wide class of errors that would otherwise not get detected due to the open-world assumption" !?
- Description / Description bundle equivalent to instance data
