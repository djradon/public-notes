- #definition: A mid-level ontology is one that adds general content to the structure outlined in the upper-level ontology by identifying types of entities which directly specialize the upper- level types, but which are also common to many domains of interest. Classes that appear in mid-level ontologies are still fairly basic with respect to particular knowledge domains and often require further specialization to be useful for data modeling (e.g., PERSON , ACT OF COMMUNICATION , or GEOPOLITICAL ENTITY).
