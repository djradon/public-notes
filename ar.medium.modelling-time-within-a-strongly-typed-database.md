  - various complexities can arise in modelling time-based data, including:
    1. Storage and Indexing: How to store time data fields so they can be accessed quickly
    2. Division and Aggregation: The smallest sensible time increment, and aggregation methods
    3. Multiple Timelines: Dealing with changing data
    4. Slowly Changing Dimensions: Classifying responses to temporal data changes
    5. Temporally Variable Schema and Data: Capturing schema and data changes
    6. Mining Temporal Relations: Methods of relating times to other times (e.g. before, after etc.)
