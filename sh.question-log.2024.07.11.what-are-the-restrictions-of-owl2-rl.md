OWL 2 RL is designed for scalable reasoning using rule-based systems and thus imposes certain restrictions to ensure that reasoning can be efficiently implemented. Here are the key restrictions of OWL 2 RL:

### 1. **Restrictions on Classes and Class Expressions**
- **No Universal Quantification**: OWL 2 RL does not support universal quantification (i.e., `owl:allValuesFrom`). This means you cannot specify that all values of a property must belong to a certain class.
- **Limited Use of Intersection and Union**: While OWL 2 RL supports intersection (using `owl:intersectionOf`), it restricts the use of unions (using `owl:unionOf`) to class expressions where one of the operands is an `owl:Thing` or `owl:Nothing`.
- **No Complement Classes**: OWL 2 RL does not support complement classes (`owl:complementOf`).

### 2. **Restrictions on Property Axioms**
- **No Property Chains**: OWL 2 RL does not allow the use of property chains (i.e., `owl:propertyChainAxiom`). This restricts the ability to infer new properties from existing ones through chains of relationships.
- **No Complex Subproperty Chains**: You cannot define complex subproperty chains where a property is a subproperty of a chain of other properties.

### 3. **Restrictions on Datatype Properties**
- **Limited Datatype Restrictions**: OWL 2 RL supports a limited set of datatype restrictions. Complex datatype expressions involving operations like intersection, union, and complement of datatypes are not allowed.
- **No Custom Datatypes**: Only predefined XML Schema datatypes are supported. Custom datatypes or user-defined datatypes are not allowed.

### 4. **Restrictions on Cardinality**
- **No Qualified Cardinality Restrictions**: OWL 2 RL does not support qualified cardinality restrictions, such as specifying that exactly three values of a property must be of a certain class.
- **Limited Cardinality**: Simple cardinality constraints (e.g., `owl:minCardinality`, `owl:maxCardinality`, and `owl:cardinality`) are supported but cannot be used with complex class expressions.

### 5. **Restrictions on Individuals**
- **No Negative Property Assertions**: OWL 2 RL does not support negative property assertions (i.e., statements that a certain relationship does not hold between individuals).

### 6. **No Advanced Class Expressions**
- **No Disjoint Union**: OWL 2 RL does not support `owl:disjointUnionOf`, which allows specifying that a class is the disjoint union of several other classes.
- **No Complex Class Axioms**: Complex axioms such as property disjointness or advanced class constructors are not allowed.

### Example OWL 2 RL Syntax:
Here's an example of an OWL 2 RL ontology with some of the allowed constructs:

```xml
<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
         xmlns:rdfs="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#"
         xmlns:owl="http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#"
         xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#">

    <!-- Define the Person class -->
    <owl:Class rdf:about="#Person"/>
    
    <!-- Define the hasChild object property -->
    <owl:ObjectProperty rdf:about="#hasChild">
        <rdfs:domain rdf:resource="#Person"/>
        <rdfs:range rdf:resource="#Person"/>
    </owl:ObjectProperty>
    
    <!-- Define the hasAge data property -->
    <owl:DatatypeProperty rdf:about="#hasAge">
        <rdfs:domain rdf:resource="#Person"/>
        <rdfs:range rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer"/>
    </owl:DatatypeProperty>
    
    <!-- Define the Parent class with restrictions -->
    <owl:Class rdf:about="#Parent">
        <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#Person"/>
        <owl:equivalentClass>
            <owl:Class>
                <owl:intersectionOf rdf:parseType="Collection">
                    <rdf:Description rdf:about="#Person"/>
                    <owl:Restriction>
                        <owl:onProperty rdf:resource="#hasChild"/>
                        <owl:someValuesFrom rdf:resource="#Person"/>
                    </owl:Restriction>
                </owl:intersectionOf>
            </owl:Class>
        </owl:equivalentClass>
    </owl:Class>
    
    <!-- Define some individuals -->
    <rdf:Description rdf:about="#John">
        <rdf:type rdf:resource="#Person"/>
        <hasAge rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">30</hasAge>
    </rdf:Description>
    
    <rdf:Description rdf:about="#Jane">
        <rdf:type rdf:resource="#Person"/>
        <hasAge rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">25</hasAge>
    </rdf:Description>
    
    <rdf:Description rdf:about="#John">
        <hasChild rdf:resource="#Jane"/>
    </rdf:Description>

</rdf:RDF>
```

### Conclusion:
OWL 2 RL is designed to be efficiently implementable using rule-based systems, which means it imposes several restrictions on the expressiveness of the language. These restrictions ensure that reasoning can be performed in a scalable and efficient manner, making OWL 2 RL suitable for applications involving large datasets where performance is critical.
