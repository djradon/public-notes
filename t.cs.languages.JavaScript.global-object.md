  -   In a web browser, any code which the script doesn't specifically start up as a background task has a [`Window`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window) as its global object. This is the vast majority of JavaScript code on the Web.
  -   Code running in a [`Worker`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worker) has a [`WorkerGlobalScope`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WorkerGlobalScope) object as its global object.
  -   Scripts running under [Node.js](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Node.js) have an object called [`global`](https://nodejs.org/api/globals.html#globals_global) as their global object.
