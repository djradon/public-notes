  - itâ€™s important to notice that Wikidata (and generally the hyper-relational paradigm) does not separate between entities and predicates used exclusively in the main triples or qualifiers, i.e., "all predicates and entities can be used either in triple terms or qualifiers"
  - The field of [[graph representation learning|t.cs.ml.grl]] (GRL) is one of the fastest-growing ðŸš€ areas of machine learning, there is a handful of articles (a series of [posts by Michael Bronstein](https://towardsdatascience.com/@michael.bronstein), reviews ([mine](https://medium.com/@mgalkin/knowledge-graphs-iclr-2020-f555c8ef10e3), [Sergeyâ€™s](https://towardsdatascience.com/top-trends-of-graph-machine-learning-in-2020-1194175351a3)) from ICLRâ€™20 and [NeurIPSâ€™19](https://medium.com/mlreview/machine-learning-on-graphs-neurips-2019-875eecd41069) papers), books (by [William Hamilton](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~wlh/grl_book/), by [Ma and Tang](http://cse.msu.edu/~mayao4/dlg_book/)), courses ([CS224W](http://cs224w.stanford.edu/), [COMP 766](https://cs.mcgill.ca/~wlh/comp766/index.html), [ESE 680](https://gnn.seas.upenn.edu/lectures/)), and even a [GraphML Telegram channel](https://t.me/graphML) (subscribe ðŸ˜‰) covering basic and advanced topics.
