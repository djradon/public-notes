  - "To solve effectively the problem of retaining and retrieving carefully articulated thought, you have to do your thinking in mnemonic patterns, shaped for ready oral recurrence. Your thoughts must come into being in heavily rhythmic, balanced patterns, in repetitions or antithesis, in alliterations or assonances, in epithetic and other formulary expressions... Serious thought is intertwined with memory systems."
    - _(Walter J. Ong, 1982, [Orality and Literacy](https://www.amazon.com/Orality-Literacy-30th-Anniversary-Accents/dp/0415538386))_
