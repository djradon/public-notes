- [[t.cs.web.accessibility]]
  - [[soln.aria]]
  - "The controls for your page should be listed in the HTML source in the order in which you expect the page to be browsed, while relying on CSS to lay out the page visually to users."
- [[t.cs.language.JavaScript]]
  - `let` is for block variables 
  - `var` is for function-scoped variables
  - initialize = declare + assign
  - `const` should get UPPER'd
    - The presence of const means the reference is protected from reassignment. But the value is not immutable and can change, especially if it's a complex construct like an object.

- [[t.cs.programming.readability]] 
  - camelCase your beautiful names
  - why not use verbs?
- [[t.cs.programming.functions.callbacks]]
  - no parens! including parens means call it now (and pass return value?)
- [[t.cs.programming.functions.anonymous]]
  - use when the func wouldn't be used anywhere else
  - presumably programmers occasionally convert anonymous functions into named functions
- [[t.cs.programming.functions.arrow]]
  - [[p.alsoKnownAs]] fat arrow functions
  - replace the word function
- [[t.cs.programming]]
