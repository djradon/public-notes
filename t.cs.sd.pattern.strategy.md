  - "The Strategy Pattern is a common pattern used by frameworks to take control of the application code execution, however, the way itâ€™s implemented by game frameworks is slightly different from what we used to read in the design pattern books. Once the strategy interface is provided by the framework layer, the user is expected to implement it and register the implementation with the framework managers."
