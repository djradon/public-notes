## Highlights
The first winners are what I call knowledge compounders. These companies control organized data that agents need and that improves continuously through real-world usage, and requires years of operations to replicate. This data isn’t widely available, so most AI agents wouldn’t have it (and it hasn’t been used to train the major models).

Every time a player makes a strategic move in a video game or a doctor confirms that a diagnosis made by AI is indeed correct, the dataset grows stronger. That learning stacks up in ways that competitors can’t shortcut through capital alone (similar to the concept of [compound engineering](https://every.to/chain-of-thought/compound-engineering-how-every-codes-with-agents)).


... 

Knowledge compounders aggregate human judgment at scale, like gamers expressing preferences or doctors confirming diagnoses. When AI agents need to check if their outputs match reality, not just sound plausible, they have to consult these datasets. The alternative is hallucination.
