## Features

- Pellet can "accept all the definitions for the URI but treat them differently for query answer-ing. For example, if the same URI is defined both as a class and as a property, Pellet will create both a class and a property and associate the axioms with the corresponding definition. Depending on the queries, asking subclasses vs. asking sub properties, the appropriate definition will be used.
