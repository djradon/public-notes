i have both
Aleissia
 ‚Äî 
Today at 9:23 AM
You'll see there's a "Lamina1UnrealSampleProject.zip" there
that's where the sample project will be
you'll want to then open the EmergenceSample.uproject that is in that zip
BeforeCrypto
 ‚Äî 
Today at 9:25 AM
yea i unzipped
Aleissia
 ‚Äî 
Today at 9:25 AM
Once you open the uproject, it will build for you, and then this sample project should open for you inside Unreal. It normally takes a few mins to build the first time around.
BeforeCrypto
 ‚Äî 
Today at 9:27 AM
The following modules are missing or built with a different engine version:

  EmergenceSample
  Emergence
  EmergenceEditor
  EmergenceEditorMethodGraphPin
  EmergenceEmailForm
  EmergenceVRMSupport
  VRM4U
  VRM4ULoader
  VRM4UCapture
  VRM4UImporter
  VRM4UEditor
  VRM4UMisc

Would you like to rebuild them now?
Aleissia
 ‚Äî 
Today at 9:27 AM
Yes, rebuild
BeforeCrypto
 ‚Äî 
Today at 9:27 AM
Its showing like this
Aleissia
 ‚Äî 
Today at 9:27 AM
that's what takes a few mins to rebuild
Wilson
 ‚Äî 
Today at 9:28 AM
is it matic ?
Aleissia
 ‚Äî 
Today at 9:28 AM
So just press YES there to rebuild. Once its done, the sample project will open up
BeforeCrypto
 ‚Äî 
Today at 9:28 AM
do i need to launch unreal now ?
Aleissia
 ‚Äî 
Today at 9:28 AM
Nope once its done rebuilding it should auto-open the project for you

If you'd like to run a local RPC node for dev (more responsive) then you can follow the instructions here:  https://docs.lamina1.com/docs/Running-a-Betanet-Node#set-up-your-node and update the Default Node URL in Emergence to http://127.0.0.1:9650/ext/bc/C/rpc 
BeforeCrypto

@Aleissia is video available for chris done today
Aleissia

Today at 9:30 AM
do we still use metamask for l1 tokens?
Aleissia
 ‚Äî 
Today at 9:30 AM
and we have the step by step in our dev docs as well. Video for both this and yesterday's will be posted later today. We'll be sure to post in both discord & Twitter (X)
Yes still use MM for L1 Tokens!
ivystive
 ‚Äî 
Today at 9:31 AM
You can definitely use MM to interact with LAMINA1. I've got instructions here on the best way to connect your LAMINA1 Hub account to your MM wallet: https://docs.google.com/document/d/18N2CVhD8xpSQRmaMl6qsM1WO4InGGJNauMFwx63_kFs/edit?usp=sharing

Unreal 5 sadly doesn't show the progress when it's building. Meh they removed that in 5. Maybe try reopening the uproject again.
BeforeCrypto
 ‚Äî 
Today at 9:35 AM
oh damn'
it showing to rebauild again
Aleissia
 ‚Äî 
Today at 9:36 AM
Do yes again, Unreal is normally smart enough to only rebuild what hasn't been built yet üòâ normally
We can also jump on with you directly to help you get setup after this @BeforeCrypto !
BeforeCrypto

Normally :sip:

Yup all will be available! Also here's the dev doc that is step by step for getting things setup!

Today at 9:38 AM
https://docs.lamina1.com/docs/the-l1-staking-wallet/#connecting-metamask-to-the-lamina1-betanet - if you need to add it as a custom network.
Okay, so while we're playing this demo to see how it works, we need to have Polygon (and MATIC tokens) for the Emergence avatar side of things, and the L1 Betanet and L1 Betanet tokens for the trophy minting, is that correct?
Aleissia
 ‚Äî 
Today at 9:41 AM
Yes that is correct. Neither are musts but there's 2 mint options in this project: 

    L1 will allow you to mint the L1 Trophy.
    Matic will allow you to mint your own VRM Avatar. So you can test out the whole flow of then having an avatar tied to your persona.


As a note, if ever you have another NFT Avatar you would love to use, we can help you get that setup, if it isn't already registered in our Emergence Avatar System.

Gameplay Examples of some things you can do with Emergence. Here you can see examples like: 

    Token gated areas
    Trading with NPCs (NFT Trading)
    Using our DynamicMetadata to add extra info to your NFTs
    Picking up collectibles / coins in game.
    A jukebox that streams your NFT music


Loads more you can do!

Today at 9:46 AM
Awesome, that makes a lot of sense (and gives me something to do to troubleshoot the issue I was having with the Unity demo).  I presume that we could retool the avatar system so that it works on the Lamina1 blockchain (provided that we either provide, or there is present, a comparable contract on Lamina1)?  I know this would not make it work across the whole Emergence ecosystem, but I'm just thinking of ways to keep things simple for Lamina1 users (to keep everything within the Lamina1 network, and users needing only the one token).
Aleissia

Right after were done here, @Chris could hop on with you! Makes me think it's a 5.3 issue! But i'm sure Chris can get a version working for u once this is done!

Hey @Jackalgirl (she/her) make sure you develop a working understanding here.
I just dropped in. I was teaching a class
Aleissia

Today at 9:48 AM
For Avatars specifically. We currently have our system working for Ethereum and Polygon. But we can def add in support for L1! 

Something we spoke about with @g0rd0 üòâ
We have a custom indexer and I know we both would love to extend it to index all NFTs (avatars included) for L1!

In future workshops. We want to dive into loads of these examples! This first 101 was meant to be able to show the basics of getting setup. And the basics of how to use the read / write functionality. From there though, future workshops will show how to use the read / write for loads of gameplay examples!

Unity and Unreal are meant to be feature parity, a few additional features today in Unreal but goal is to get to full feature parity for Emergence.

From an engine perspective, Unreal is alot more visual designer focused because of blueprints. Which can be great for non-coders.

Q: for dynamic metadata, would this be a seperate layer of metadata that can applied to already existing NFT collections?  and this layer of metadata would not be on chain?  i.e. used specifically for in-game logic**

follow up:  would there be a way to allow this dynamic metadata to be written and thus change an NFT's actual on chain metadata?  like it's artwork or a type of metadata that is already on chain?

hope that makes sense ty

There are some interesting ways to do this by wrapping existing NFTs to extend functionality. It raises questions about who is allowed to extend functionality and how to use that functionality which we're working on
Aleissia
 ‚Äî 
Today at 10:06 AM
Great question! 

As of right now, this is a way to add additional metadata to NFT collections. That is currently saved off-chain with using all the authentication / etc of what the owner of the NFT sets for it. 

We are also building out standard templates so NEW nft creators can utilize that as well. 

Goal is to be allow any creator / developer to treat an NFT like a game object. Read/Write based on the permissions the owner sets.
Future workshop JUST on Dynamic Metadata would be fun!
