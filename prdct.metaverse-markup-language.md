## Description

The "MML stack" is a combination of two main pieces usually combined together:

- MML (Language) - 3D HTML elements and attributes for describing 3D objects and experiences
- Networked DOM (Networking) - A library and network protocol for running MML/HTML documents on a server so that multiple users can interact with them in a multi-user mode.

HTML and JavaScript in the form of the DOM (Document Object Model) provide an existing foundation for describing and mutating a hierarchy of elements. MML uses this foundation with new elements and attributes to allow describing 3D concepts.


## Features

- Portability: MML documents can run in any modern web browser, making them easy to share and view.
- Composability: MML documents can be composed of multiple documents running on different servers, making it possible to create complex virtual world objects without having to provide all the compute power and technical capability on a single server.
