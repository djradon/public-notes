## Pros

- "Vue combines the best of Angular, with the best of React and the healthiest, most farsighted community. Especially with vue3, everything just freaking works. DX is phenomenal and rapid. Every primitive I've needed, as well as assisting utils, to build from 500+ cmp corporate apps to ~20 cmp internal apps is there, opinionated, boilerplate-free, ready for me to convert ideas into results with little in-between. Performance is the default with little to no footguns. Spectacular docs. There's the official, robust, helpful linter config and style guide. Has the cleanest reactivity model based on native js primitives (Proxy API). Has spawned the best build tooling (vite) and were cool and smart enough to colab with everyone, "competitors" or not, to help them switch to it too (!). Has spawned the best testing tooling (vitest), 10x better than anything before it, and again working with the community to make it usable for all and migration a breeze."
