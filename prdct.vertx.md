## Pros

- Pick the best asynchronous programming model for your problem domain

We know that asyn­chro­nous pro­gram­ming re­quires more ef­forts. At the core of Vert.x, we sup­port call­backs and promises/fu­tures, the lat­ter being a sim­ple and el­e­gant model for chain­ing asyn­chro­nous op­er­a­tions.

Ad­vanced re­ac­tive pro­gram­ming is pos­si­ble with Rx­Java, and if you pre­fer some­thing closer to tra­di­tional im­per­a­tive pro­gram­ming, then we are happy to pro­vide you with first-​class sup­port of Kotlin corou­tines.
