## Highlights

- "The Interaction Model of W3C WoT introduces an intermediate abstraction that formalizes the mapping from application intent to concrete protocol operations and also narrows the possibilities how Interaction Affordances can be modeled."
  - [Interaction Affordance](https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-architecture/#dfn-interaction-affordance) is a lot like REST's [[t.cs.web.hateoas]]
