## kosmion dev 10/12

It looks like you're requesting a summary or update of the development related to Kosmion as of October 12th. Based on the most recent updates and your relator-based approach, here are some key details from the development of Kosmion up to this point:

1. **Relator-Based Approach**: You’ve settled on using a relator-based structure, where predicates become classes, and specific predicate instances become expressions of those classes. This allows for greater flexibility in modeling relationships, and you’re considering avoiding OWL Full for now while continuing to refine the approach.
   
2. **Immutability & Bitemporality**: You’ve moved towards making Kosmion immutable with bitemporality using both 'system-time' (aka 'transaction-time') and 'valid-time' for temporal modeling. You're exploring the idea of system-time as external metadata that governs immutability, while valid-time is treated as internal data.

3. **Naming and Metadata**: You've been working on a naming convention, leaning towards terms like 'genesis' and 'tombstone' (or 'relator-genesis' and 'relator-tombstone') to represent the birth and death of statements, and preferring 'relator-' as a prefix for metadata. 

4. **Slash-Based IRIs**: You're using slash-based IRIs for the Kosmion ontology, establishing a namespace (`https://kosmion.github.io/ont/v0/`) to structure the ontology.

5. **Metadata vs. Data**: You clarified that metadata will not use relators. For example, class membership like `:Person1 a :Person` would be treated as metadata and not included in the relator framework.

6. **Facets and Aspects**: There’s a developing idea where facets (singular properties) might contribute to aspects (emergent properties), but this is still in the exploratory phase for future discussion.

7. **Versioning Strategy**: You are working on a versioning strategy for handling changes to the ontology, where typo corrections or mistakes would be classified as PATCH changes, adding new data would be MINOR, and changing existing data would be considered a MAJOR update.

8. **Redundant Data**: You are considering duplicating relators from relator datasets into the corresponding entity datasets, favoring redundancy to enable consistency checks and smoother attribute management.

If you're looking for more specific details about progress from that date or an update on particular parts of development, let me know!


## regarding #5, I'm thinking to supplant class membership with facets and/or aspects. The kosmion ontology itself might use class hierarchies, but I'd like it to use relators too if that ends up making sense.


Got it! Replacing class membership with facets and/or aspects could give more flexibility, especially if emergent properties can dynamically represent membership or classification based on context. Using relators for class hierarchies within Kosmion also sounds interesting—it could open up new ways of expressing relationships between classes. If you find that relators streamline this kind of hierarchy without losing semantic clarity, it could unify the modeling approach.

Let me know if you want to dive deeper into any aspect of this transition or explore how relators might fit into class hierarchies.

## How does dolce use relators, aka reified relations.

In DOLCE (Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering), relators (also known as reified relations) are a key concept used to model complex relationships between entities. Here's how DOLCE approaches relators and reified relations:

### Relators in DOLCE:
A **relator** in DOLCE is an entity that mediates or relates two or more other entities (called "relata"). Instead of using a simple direct relation between two entities (like a binary predicate), DOLCE uses relators to represent more complex situations where additional contextual information or properties about the relationship itself are needed. This is often referred to as **reified relations** because the relationship is treated as a first-class entity (a relator) in the ontology.

### Structure of Relators:
In DOLCE, a relator relates multiple entities by connecting them through **roles**. Each entity involved in the relation plays a specific role. The roles themselves are also explicitly modeled as individuals in the ontology.

- **Relator**: An abstract object that represents the relationship as a first-class entity.
- **Roles**: Define the part that each related entity plays in the relationship. Each role is connected to the relator.
- **Mediated entities (relata)**: The entities that the relator connects through their respective roles.

### Example:
Let’s say we have a **marriage** relationship between two people. In DOLCE:
- The **marriage** would be represented by a relator (i.e., the marriage itself is an entity).
- Each spouse would be connected to the marriage relator by a **role** (e.g., "spouse role").
- The actual individuals (the spouses) are the entities that play these roles.

In this case, the **marriage relator** connects the two individuals through their roles as spouses. This allows for adding more detailed information to the marriage (e.g., start date, location, legal status) that would be difficult to represent with just a direct relation between two individuals.

### Formalization:
In DOLCE, relators are formalized as follows:
- A **relator** is a subtype of **non-physical endurant** (meaning it is something that persists over time but is not physical).
- Relators require at least two **roles** to be associated with them, and each role must be connected to an entity that participates in the relationship.
- A role mediates between the relator and the specific entities.

### Key Concepts in DOLCE:
- **Endurants**: Persistent entities, including physical and non-physical ones.
- **Perdurants**: Events or processes that occur in time (which can also be related via relators).
- **Roles**: Functions or parts played by entities in the context of a relator.

### Why Relators?
Relators in DOLCE enable a more detailed and flexible modeling of relationships:
1. **Contextual Information**: By treating relationships as entities, you can attach information directly to the relationship (e.g., temporal, spatial, or contextual properties).
2. **Higher-order Relations**: Relators can mediate more than two entities, making them useful for complex n-ary relationships.
3. **Explicit Role Representation**: By representing roles explicitly, DOLCE ensures clarity in how entities participate in a relationship.

### Comparison with Kosmion:
In your **Kosmion ontology**, the use of relators seems aligned with DOLCE’s approach, where relators represent relationships between entities via roles. If you consider facets or aspects for class membership, relators could also manage the dynamics of how entities play certain roles, without committing to rigid class structures. If you decide to use relators for class hierarchies, you might model class relationships similarly to how DOLCE handles roles between entities and relators, giving you a way to represent evolving or contextualized classifications.

Would this approach fit with your current direction for Kosmion? Let me know if you want to explore how these ideas might map onto your ontology!


## Yes, I think it fits. One difference we've talked about: Kosmion would use relators even for unary relationships.

Great! That distinction makes sense, especially if you're aiming for a consistent and flexible way to represent all kinds of relationships, including unary ones, with relators. This could give you more power to manage the context and evolution of even simple relationships, treating them with the same depth as more complex ones. 

Let me know if you'd like to explore examples of how Kosmion could handle unary relators, or if you want to work out any specific cases!

## Assuming a file-based repository of RDF data, could every file be considered a dataset?

Yes, in a file-based repository of RDF data, every file can be considered a **dataset** depending on how you want to organize and conceptualize the data.

In RDF terms, a **dataset** generally consists of a collection of **graphs**, which may include a **default graph** and any number of **named graphs**. Here’s how it could map to a file-based system:

### Case 1: Single Graph Per File (Simplest Case)
- **One file = One graph**: If each RDF file contains a single graph (whether a default graph or a named graph), then the file can be treated as a standalone dataset. This is common when dealing with smaller or more isolated datasets.
- **Named Graph**: You could define the graph’s name in the file or, depending on the format, assume that the file implicitly represents the default graph.

### Case 2: Multiple Graphs Per File
- **One file = Multiple graphs**: If a file contains multiple named graphs, this is still aligned with the RDF dataset model. For example, a file could include several named graphs, and this file would represent a single RDF dataset with multiple components.
- **Formats**: In formats like TriG (or N-Quads), which support multiple graphs in one file, this approach is straightforward. The file would act as a container for all the graphs, meaning each file is effectively a dataset.

### Case 3: Dataset as a Conceptual Group
Even if a file contains just a fragment of data, you can treat it as part of a larger conceptual **dataset**. In this case, your repository structure might represent:
- A **collection of datasets**: Multiple files that each represent a part of a larger dataset. Here, files might correspond to different graphs, and the dataset is formed by aggregating these files.

### Considerations:
- **File Naming and Graph Identification**: If each file represents a named graph, you might want a consistent naming convention that reflects the graph name or a metadata header to identify it.
- **Performance**: Treating each file as a dataset makes it easier to manage or update specific segments of the RDF data independently. However, performance considerations may arise depending on the number of files and how the data is queried or accessed.

### Kosmion Context
In Kosmion, if you're using **relators** and possibly adopting **named graphs** for each relator, treating each file as a dataset containing one or more named graphs could fit well. This approach would allow you to:
1. **Isolate relator-based clusters** in separate files.
2. **Version or update individual relators** without needing to modify other parts of the ontology.

This would work especially well if you're aiming for a decentralized and modular file-based structure where each file represents a specific facet of your ontology.

Does this align with how you're thinking of structuring RDF data in Kosmion?

## it does++

- dave: So <dave-richardson> would represent an entity, every entity could reference at least one catalog which could "live" anywhere but <dave-richardson/catalog> would be a good first choice, and be referenced from the catalog dataset, say <dave-richardson/catalog/dist> which might have a Turtle distribution named <dave-richardson/catalog/dist/ttl>. But the entity itself could (and should, if no data catalog is referenced) identify at least one dataset directly that is considered the "current" dataset. So <dave-richardson/datasets/v1> could be the corresponding dataset. The different datasets would primarily be used for versioning or for spreading out data over multiple dataset files (in which case a data catalog should be used). I'm inclined against a dataset per relator. I'm not sure what role the named graphs would play any more if there's a dataset per version. Maybe metadata.

- chatgpt:

It sounds like you've settled on a clean structure for organizing entities and datasets, where catalogs and datasets play distinct roles. I think your approach strikes a good balance between modularity (with catalogs) and versioning (with datasets like `<dave-richardson/datasets/v1>`). This allows flexibility in terms of data distribution while keeping a "current" dataset accessible when necessary.

### Named Graphs and Metadata
Since you're thinking about named graphs potentially being useful for metadata, that could work well for things like:
- **Provenance information**: Tracking where the data came from or who created it.
- **Versioning info**: Storing details about when and how a particular dataset was created or modified.
- **Contextual data**: If you need to add contextual information (e.g., temporal or spatial data) to a dataset, a named graph could isolate that metadata without cluttering the primary data.

If you decide to avoid using named graphs for the data itself and instead focus on datasets per version, using them just for metadata makes sense, keeping the structure straightforward.

Let me know if you want to explore any of these aspects further!


## Default Representations

- dave: I wouldn't say settled. But certainly a possibility. There's probably value in the idea of a "default representation" and "default catalog", where the person with access to the IRI-enclosing namespace has control of default and alternate representations , but can delegate total control (by pointing to someone else's data catalog AND default dataset) or partial control (delegating either one). A default catalog could specify its own default represenetation, so there could effectively be two defaults. But that's okay.

- chatgpt: 

That makes sense, especially with the flexibility of delegating control over the catalog or dataset. Having a **"default representation"** and **"default catalog"** controlled by the namespace owner, while allowing delegation, gives you a powerful mechanism for managing data access and structure. It also opens up the possibility of collaborative or distributed data management without losing control over the core representations.

The potential for two defaults (one for the representation and one for the catalog) doesn’t seem problematic, especially if each serves a distinct purpose. The default catalog could handle the organization of data, while the default representation could specify how the data is accessed or interpreted.

If you're still exploring, this setup offers a lot of flexibility. Let me know if you want to dive deeper into specific delegation scenarios or ways to manage defaults!


## ontology vs semantic data

- dave: can you provide references to papers, articles, blog posts, or social media where people argue that ontology does not imply "semantic data" in general or "knowledge graphs" in general? That the term "ontology" should be reserved for domain concepts, analagous to a schema?

- chatgpt:

There are multiple discussions and arguments that highlight the difference between ontologies and the broader concepts of "semantic data" or "knowledge graphs," where the term "ontology" is often more narrowly defined.

1. **Ontologies as Domain-Specific Models**: Some experts argue that an ontology should primarily be viewed as a structured, domain-specific framework for organizing concepts, more analogous to a schema. This perspective suggests that ontologies provide a controlled vocabulary and relationships specific to a domain, whereas knowledge graphs often involve broader integration of data, including instance-level data, which isn't always tied to an explicit, domain-specific ontology. For example, ontologies like the **Gene Ontology** (GO) are specifically tailored to biological knowledge, focusing on well-defined relationships within that context, distinct from general knowledge graphs that handle diverse or cross-domain data【34†source】【35†source】.

2. **Ontologies vs. Knowledge Graphs**: It is often emphasized that **knowledge graphs** are not synonymous with ontologies. Knowledge graphs may include data representations that don’t leverage full semantic inferencing or may involve vast amounts of instance data (like Google’s Knowledge Graph) without the formal semantics typical of an ontology. Some argue that the **schema** in a knowledge graph can exist without the rich conceptual relationships that define an ontology【33†source】【34†source】.

3. **Schema vs. Ontology**: Ontologies are often described as more flexible and expressive frameworks than rigid schemas, but there are arguments that ontologies should focus solely on domain modeling, similar to a schema, rather than broader tasks like data integration or reasoning across large datasets, which are common use cases for knowledge graphs. In this view, ontologies should serve as a "blueprint" for domain concepts, focusing on classes and relationships, rather than extending into instance data and semantic reasoning that knowledge graphs address【35†source】【36†source】.

In summary, many argue that ontologies should remain more like a **schema**, focused on domain concepts, rather than being conflated with the broader tasks of **semantic data** or **knowledge graphs**, which may encompass much more than what ontologies are intended to model.

## So I want to be able to apply metadata like context (the reality where the statements are asserted true), system-time (the period for which they were asserted), and attribution (who asserted) to be applicable on two levels: the individual relator and the datasets (i.e., all relators in the dataset). Maybe context includes the other. But maybe we need a term other than metadata, because it's really more just data. e.g. :Bart  a :Person in context:Simpsons-World

Your idea of applying context, system-time, and attribution as **data** rather than metadata makes sense, especially given that these elements are intrinsic to the assertions themselves. The distinction you're making is crucial: these aren't just metadata annotations but are part of the core reality being modeled.

To apply this at **two levels**—for both the **relator** and the **dataset**—you can think of:

### 1. **Relator-Level Context**:
Each relator would carry its own information about:
- **Context**: The world or reality where this relation holds true. For example, `context:Simpsons-World` applies directly to a relation like `:Bart a :Person`.
- **System-Time**: The period during which the relation is valid, possibly encoded as the system-level start and end times.
- **Attribution**: Who asserted or originated the relation, possibly using a relator-creator property.

Example (relator-level):
```turtle
:Relator1 a :KnowsRelator ;
    :subject :Bart ;
    :object :Homer ;
    :context context:Simpsons-World ;
    :relator-genesis "2024-10-21T00:00:00Z"^^xsd:dateTime ;
    :relator-creator :MattGroening .
```

### 2. **Dataset-Level Context**:
For dataset-level context, which would apply to all relators in a dataset, you might specify a broader context that encompasses all the relations in the dataset. This would be useful for large-scale assertions, like stating that all relations in a file apply to a certain reality, were asserted within a certain time frame, or were all attributed to the same source.

If you treat context as hierarchical or containing other elements, this could mean that the dataset-level context applies as a broader frame, and the relator-specific context could add nuance or specialize it.

Example (dataset-level):
```turtle
:Dataset1 a :Dataset ;
    :context context:Simpsons-Universe ;
    :dataset-creator :MattGroening ;
    :system-time-start "2024-10-21T00:00:00Z"^^xsd:dateTime ;
    :system-time-end "2024-11-21T00:00:00Z"^^xsd:dateTime .
```

All relators in `Dataset1` would inherit `context:Simpsons-Universe`, unless overridden by individual relators. This allows you to:
- Apply broad contexts or attribution to all relations.
- Specialize individual relations with more granular context or time-based assertions if needed.

### Naming Considerations
You mentioned looking for another term besides "metadata." Since you're thinking of these as part of the **core data**, you could use terms like:
- **Contextual Data**: Emphasizing that this is part of the relation itself, not external metadata.
- **Assertion Context**: This could indicate the reality or system-time in which the assertion is true.
- **Relational Scope**: To emphasize that context applies to the scope in which relations are true or valid.

This dual-level structure could work well with your relator-based approach, especially when combined with versioning and system-time management. Let me know if you'd like further refinement on specific areas!

## Actually, I guess there should be three levels. The third is "[named] graph"

Adding a **third level** for the **named graph** is a logical extension that helps organize and scope the applicability of context, system-time, and attribution more precisely. Here's how this might break down:

### 1. **Relator-Level Context**:
At the most granular level, each individual relator can carry its own context, system-time, and attribution data. This would allow fine-tuned control over the assertions made by that specific relation.

Example:
```turtle
:Relator1 a :KnowsRelator ;
    :subject :Bart ;
    :object :Homer ;
    :context context:Simpsons-World ;
    :relator-genesis "2024-10-21T00:00:00Z"^^xsd:dateTime ;
    :relator-creator :MattGroening .
```

### 2. **Named Graph-Level Context**:
Named graphs serve as a middle layer, where all assertions (relators) within a graph share common metadata. This is ideal when a collection of assertions is being grouped under a particular context, time frame, or source.

Example:
```turtle
GRAPH <http://example.com/graph/simpsons> {
    :Relator1 a :KnowsRelator ;
    :subject :Bart ;
    :object :Homer .
    :Relator2 a :WorksForRelator ;
    :subject :Homer ;
    :object :SpringfieldNuclearPlant .
}
<http://example.com/graph/simpsons> :context context:Simpsons-World ;
    :system-time-start "2024-10-01T00:00:00Z"^^xsd:dateTime ;
    :attribution :MattGroening .
```

### 3. **Dataset-Level Context**:
At the highest level, a dataset containing multiple named graphs could also include shared context, system-time, and attribution that apply to all the named graphs and their relations. This can provide a blanket set of metadata for all graphs in a dataset, but individual graphs or relators can still override this if necessary.

Example:
```turtle
:Dataset1 a :Dataset ;
    :context context:Simpsons-Multiverse ;
    :dataset-creator :Fox ;
    :system-time-start "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z"^^xsd:dateTime .

GRAPH <http://example.com/graph/simpsons> {
    :Relator1 a :KnowsRelator ;
    :subject :Bart ;
    :object :Homer .
    :Relator2 a :WorksForRelator ;
    :subject :Homer ;
    :object :SpringfieldNuclearPlant .
}
```

### Usage Breakdown:
- **Relator Level**: Fine-grained metadata for specific relations, useful for capturing individual attribution or time context.
- **Named Graph Level**: Shared metadata for collections of relations, allowing you to group relators with common metadata.
- **Dataset Level**: High-level metadata that applies across multiple named graphs, providing context for versioning or large-scale assertions.

This structure gives you flexibility at every level, ensuring that metadata (or context) is precisely scoped based on how detailed or broad you want the assertions to be.

Would you like to dive deeper into any particular level or explore specific use cases for managing these contexts across multiple datasets or versions?


## It really does get confusing with "data about the thing" vs "data about the data".  Maybe the default graph is always data about the data, and data about the thing is always contextualized?

You're absolutely right that the distinction between "data about the thing" and "data about the data" can get confusing, particularly when modeling metadata in RDF or related structures.

One way to resolve this is by clearly separating **contextualized data (about the thing)** from **metadata (about the data itself)**. Your suggestion to use the **default graph** for metadata and **contextualized graphs** (e.g., named graphs) for the actual data makes a lot of sense.

### Conceptual Framework:

1. **Default Graph for Metadata**:
   The **default graph** can contain system-level information, versioning, provenance, or any other data describing the structure or source of the dataset. Essentially, this would be the "data about the data" that applies to the entire dataset or specific named graphs.

   Example:
   ```turtle
   :Dataset1 a :Dataset ;
       :creator :Fox ;
       :version "v1.0" ;
       :generatedAt "2024-10-21T00:00:00Z"^^xsd:dateTime .
   ```

2. **Named Graphs for Contextualized Data**:
   **Named graphs** would then represent specific chunks of data that are contextualized within a particular reality, time period, or attribution. These named graphs are where the actual domain data (i.e., data about the thing) resides.

   Example:
   ```turtle
   GRAPH <http://example.com/graph/simpsons> {
       :Bart a :Person ;
           :context context:Simpsons-World ;
           :livesIn :Springfield .
   }
   ```

3. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - **Default Graph (Metadata)**: Contains all system-level information like who asserted the dataset, when it was generated, version control, etc.
   - **Named Graphs (Contextualized Data)**: Contains data that is tied to specific domains, contexts, or realities, giving flexibility for handling different "worlds" or interpretations of the data.

### Benefits:
- **Clear separation** between **"data about the thing"** (which is in the named/contextual graphs) and **"data about the data"** (which is in the default graph).
- This approach allows **flexibility** for managing multiple contexts or realities while ensuring that system-level metadata is isolated and easy to manage.
  
### Possible Pitfall:
While this approach simplifies the structure conceptually, it requires careful handling during **querying** and **data updates**, ensuring the right graph is targeted for different types of information (metadata vs. contextual data).

Would this approach fit with the structure you're envisioning for Kosmion, especially with the relator-based model? Let me know if you'd like to go deeper into any specific scenarios or practical implications!

## If you store a complete snapshot every time (i.e., in a new graph or a new dataset), you don't really need deltas? You could note the delta source and reason per-relator, per graph, or per-dataset.

Yes, if you're storing a **complete snapshot** in each new graph or dataset, you effectively eliminate the need for deltas (which track only the changes between versions). Instead, you can still maintain a notion of **delta source and reason** for tracking why certain changes were made, without the complexity of reconstructing deltas for every change.

### Here's how this approach could work:

1. **Complete Snapshots**:
   - Each version of your data is stored as a full snapshot in either a new **named graph** or a new **dataset**. This means that you have a full, self-contained version of the dataset at every point in time, which simplifies retrieval and avoids the complexity of managing deltas.

2. **Delta Source & Reason**:
   - Instead of storing explicit deltas, you could track the **source** of changes (who or what initiated the modification) and the **reason** (e.g., typo fix, data update, correction) at different levels: 
     - **Per-relator**: Each relator could carry metadata about its source and why it was updated or created.
     - **Per-graph**: A named graph could carry metadata about the changes it contains and why the snapshot was made.
     - **Per-dataset**: The dataset as a whole could track a high-level reason for its creation, versioning, and updates.

### Example:
```turtle
:Dataset1 a :Dataset ;
    :version "v1.0" ;
    :createdBy :Fox ;
    :reason "Initial data ingestion" .

GRAPH <http://example.com/graph/simpsons-v1> {
    :Bart a :Person ;
        :livesIn :Springfield .
}

:Dataset2 a :Dataset ;
    :version "v2.0" ;
    :createdBy :Fox ;
    :reason "Updated location for Bart" .

GRAPH <http://example.com/graph/simpsons-v2> {
    :Bart a :Person ;
        :livesIn :Shelbyville ;
        :relator-delta-source :User123 ;
        :relator-delta-reason "Correction" .
}
```

This model allows you to retain **complete version histories** while still explaining why changes were made, at whatever level of granularity you need.

### Advantages:
- **Simplifies management**: No need to compute or manage deltas between versions.
- **Easy retrieval**: Any version can be retrieved as a full snapshot without needing to reconstruct it from earlier versions.
- **Context for changes**: You still maintain the ability to explain why changes happened and who made them without adding complexity to the data structure.

### Use Cases:
This approach works well when:
- **Storage** is not a constraint, as you’re storing full snapshots.
- **Data auditability** is important, and you want to track changes explicitly at various levels.
  
Would this fit with your plans for Kosmion? Let me know if you'd like to explore any details further!

## In my Kosmion ontology, where I want to embrace multi-level theory where things are individuals and classes. Can you think of any places "owl:NamedIndividual" could be useful. 

In your Kosmion ontology, which aims to embrace **multi-level theory** where things are both **individuals and classes**, **owl:NamedIndividual** could be quite useful in several ways. Here are some key areas where it could be applied:

### 1. **Multi-Level Entities**
In a multi-level ontology, entities can exist at different levels (e.g., a template or a prototype that is both an instance and a class). **owl:NamedIndividual** allows you to represent an entity that is both a concrete individual and a class that can have instances. For example, an individual reality like `:RealityPrime` could be both:
- An **instance** of the class `:Reality` at one level, and
- A **class** for other, more specific realities (e.g., `:SimpsonsWorld`).

This dual representation fits with **multi-level modeling**, where levels of abstraction coexist, and something can be a concrete individual while also serving as a type.

### 2. **Relators as Individuals and Classes**
Your relator-based approach could also benefit from **owl:NamedIndividual** when a relator serves both as a specific instance of a relationship (linking specific entities) and as a general class of relationships. For instance:
- A specific relationship like `:BartKnowsHomerRelator` could be a **NamedIndividual** while also being a **class** that other similar relationships instantiate (e.g., `:LisaKnowsMargeRelator`).

### 3. **ETDF Datatypes as Individuals and Classes**
Since you've mentioned EDTF datatypes are both classes and individuals, **owl:NamedIndividual** can allow you to treat a particular date format as both:
- A **class** representing a general type of date, such as `EDTF_Year`.
- An **individual**, such as `EDTF_Year2024`, which is a concrete instance of that type.

### 4. **Contexts or Worlds**
If you're modeling different **contexts or worlds** (e.g., `:SimpsonsWorld`, `:RealityPrime`), these can be treated as **NamedIndividuals** that are both:
- **Concrete instances** of broader categories of realities or contexts.
- **Classes** that further specialize into more specific contexts (e.g., `:SimpsonsSeason1`).

### 5. **Facets as Both Instances and Classes**
If you're implementing **facets** (singular properties) as a fundamental unit, a facet can be both an individual and a class. For instance, a facet like `:Gender` can be an individual, but you might also want it to act as a class for more specific instantiations such as `:Male` or `:Female`.

By using **owl:NamedIndividual**, you can manage this fluid boundary between **types and instances**, allowing entities to operate as both, depending on the context or level in the ontology.

Would this structure align with your multi-level modeling needs in Kosmion? Let me know if you’d like to explore specific examples!

## instead of IRI-naming things with a "v1", "v2", should we just number consecutively as "1", "2", skips parsing and eliminates having to look at a lot of "v"s, but on the other hand, they do reduce ambiguity


Using consecutive numbering like "1", "2", instead of prefixes like "v1", "v2" for versioning has pros and cons depending on your goals:

### Pros of Consecutive Numbering:
1. **Simplifies Parsing**: Without the "v", parsing is easier, especially in automated processes where distinguishing the version number from the rest of the IRI might be unnecessary. It reduces the need to strip characters or check for prefixes.
2. **Visual Cleanliness**: Eliminates the extra character, making IRIs cleaner, especially when working with long or deeply nested IRI structures.

### Cons of Removing "v":
1. **Potential Ambiguity**: The absence of the "v" could lead to confusion if the numbering scheme isn’t immediately clear to users or systems. For example, without the "v", it may not be obvious that "1" or "2" represents a version number.
2. **Context Clarity**: Using "v" explicitly denotes that the number refers to a version, making it clear that you're referring to different snapshots or states of the same entity or dataset, which helps especially in collaborative or public settings where multiple versioning schemes may coexist.

### Trade-off:
- **Consecutive numbering** is more concise and simplifies processing but may sacrifice some of the clarity provided by explicitly marking versions.
- **Including "v"** helps ensure that it's immediately clear the number is a version, but it introduces a slight increase in complexity for parsing and visual scanning.

If your environment prioritizes clarity and collaboration across teams or users unfamiliar with the specifics of the system, keeping the "v" might be preferable. If you're working in a more controlled, internal system where reducing complexity and maximizing efficiency is key, skipping the "v" could be an advantage.

You could also consider making the decision based on the **context** where the versions will be used.


## How can I distinguish between a dataset and thing described by a dataset.

To distinguish between a **dataset** and a **thing described by a dataset** within an RDF or OWL context, you can follow these guidelines:

### 1. **Dataset as Metadata Carrier**:
A **dataset** typically represents a collection of statements, which can be about many things (entities, relationships, etc.). The dataset itself can have **metadata** that describes the **provenance**, **versioning**, or **context** of the dataset, separate from the entities it describes. You can represent a dataset as a **container** or **collection** of RDF triples, using something like **VoID (Vocabulary of Interlinked Datasets)** or **DCAT (Data Catalog Vocabulary)**.

For example, the dataset can be described like this:
```turtle
:Dataset1 a dcat:Dataset ;
    dct:title "Simpsons Data" ;
    dct:created "2024-10-21"^^xsd:date ;
    dct:creator :MattGroening ;
    dcat:distribution :SimpsonsDatasetDistribution .
```

This metadata describes the dataset as a whole, not the entities described within the dataset.

### 2. **Thing Described by a Dataset**:
The **things** described by the dataset are the actual entities (e.g., people, objects, concepts) that the RDF triples within the dataset describe. These are the **subject** or **objects** in the RDF data, like a person, organization, event, etc.

For example, a thing described by the dataset could be `:BartSimpson`, an individual entity that exists **inside** the dataset:
```turtle
:BartSimpson a :Person ;
    :name "Bart Simpson" ;
    :livesIn :Springfield .
```

### 3. **Using Named Graphs for Context Separation**:
You can use **named graphs** to separate **dataset-level** metadata from **entity descriptions**. The named graph contains the **descriptions of entities**, while the dataset itself (which might be the whole graph or collection of graphs) is associated with its own metadata.

Example:
```turtle
GRAPH <http://example.com/graph/simpsons> {
    :BartSimpson a :Person ;
        :livesIn :Springfield .
}
```

And then the dataset itself can have metadata:
```turtle
:SimpsonsDataset a dcat:Dataset ;
    dcat:theme :FictionalCharacters ;
    dcat:distribution <http://example.com/graph/simpsons> .
```

### 4. **Ontology-Based Differentiation**:
If you're working within OWL or another ontology, you can further differentiate the **dataset** from the **things it describes** by classifying them differently:
- **Dataset**: Use classes like `dcat:Dataset`, `void:Dataset`, or `prov:Entity`.
- **Things Described**: Use relevant **domain-specific classes**, such as `:Person`, `:Location`, `:Event`, etc.

This ensures clarity when defining the type of each resource.

In summary, you distinguish between a dataset and the things it describes by:
- **Dataset**: Described using **metadata vocabularies** like DCAT, VoID, or PROV, representing the container or structure of the data.
- **Things**: Represented as **domain-specific classes** that describe actual entities within the dataset.

## IRI conceptual collisions

- dave:

Let me give you more background on my issue. Say there was an IRI "https://example.org/BartSimpson" that I want to refer to an individual, (e.g., an owl:Thing). Conventionally, if you retrieved some RDF from that URL, it would return a dataset about Bart Simpson. But then the IRI also refers to a dataset. even if the RDF returned is only a simple statement, e.g. ":BartSimpson a :Person", that's still a dataset. Even if it's only metadata, e.g. ':BartSimpson rdfs:comment "a page about Bart"', it still a dataset. Even if it's a dcat Catalog pointing to places where data and metadata exist, or a pointer to a dcat catalog, that's all a dataset.

- chatgpt:

You've described a common issue in RDF and linked data, where the **same IRI** is being used to refer both to an **individual** (such as a person, e.g., Bart Simpson) and to a **dataset** that describes that individual. This results in a conceptual collision between referring to an **entity** and referring to **data about the entity**.

### Key Concepts:
- **Individual (Entity)**: In this case, `:BartSimpson` is an **owl:Thing** (or possibly an `owl:NamedIndividual`), a real or fictional entity being described.
- **Dataset**: The RDF returned from `https://example.org/BartSimpson` is a dataset, even if it contains only a single RDF statement like `:BartSimpson a :Person`.

### Challenge:
The issue is that by convention, the IRI both points to **data about** Bart Simpson (a dataset) and to **Bart Simpson himself** (an individual entity). Even a simple RDF statement such as `:BartSimpson a :Person` can be considered a **dataset**. As a result, the IRI is overloaded with dual meaning, potentially causing confusion.

### Solutions:
1. **Separation of Concerns: Different IRIs for Entity and Dataset**:
   A simple approach is to use **different IRIs** for the **individual** and the **dataset** that describes the individual.
   - For example:
     - Use `https://example.org/BartSimpson` to refer to **Bart Simpson** the individual.
     - Use `https://example.org/datasets/BartSimpson` to refer to a **dataset** about Bart Simpson.
   This way, the distinction is clear: one IRI points to the actual entity, while the other points to the dataset that describes the entity.

2. **Use of Fragment Identifiers**:
   Another approach is to use **fragment identifiers** (`#`):
   - `https://example.org/BartSimpson` refers to the **individual** Bart Simpson.
   - `https://example.org/BartSimpson#data` refers to the **dataset** about Bart Simpson.
   Fragment identifiers are often used to distinguish between resources while keeping the base IRI the same, allowing a clean distinction between an entity and data about the entity.

3. **Conventional Use of Linked Data Resources**:
   You could follow the linked data pattern where:
   - `https://example.org/BartSimpson` is understood to be the **individual** (the actual person or entity), and the RDF data returned provides descriptions **about** Bart Simpson (metadata). 
   In this case, the dataset is implicit, and it's common practice for the IRI to resolve to a dataset that describes the entity.
   
   However, this pattern leaves it ambiguous whether the IRI refers to the **entity** or the **dataset**. To resolve this ambiguity, you might:
   - Include explicit metadata using vocabularies like **DCAT** or **PROV** to indicate that the dataset refers to a description **about** the individual, not the individual itself:
     ```turtle
     :BartSimpson a :Person ;
        rdfs:comment "This is Bart Simpson, a fictional character from The Simpsons." .

     :BartSimpsonDescription a dcat:Dataset ;
        dct:description "A dataset about Bart Simpson." ;
        dcat:keyword "Simpsons, Character" .
     ```

4. **Contextualizing Data with Named Graphs**:
   If the dataset contains more detailed information and metadata, you can use **named graphs** to differentiate between the **data about the entity** and the **entity itself**. For example:
   ```turtle
   GRAPH <https://example.org/datasets/BartSimpson> {
       :BartSimpson a :Person ;
       :BartSimpson rdfs:comment "Fictional character from The Simpsons." .
   }
   ```

### Practical Takeaway:
- **Different IRIs** for the entity and dataset are the most straightforward solution, ensuring clarity for both human users and machines.
- **Fragment identifiers** offer a way to distinguish between different aspects (the individual vs. the dataset) while maintaining the base IRI.
- If you prefer to keep a single IRI, you could lean on linked data conventions but include explicit metadata to clarify whether you're referring to the entity or the dataset.

This approach should help clarify the distinction between an **individual** and the **dataset** describing it in Kosmion or similar systems.

## HTML is the answer anyhow

- dave:

If I use different IRIs, how to I make the datasets and data catalogs discoverable from the initial IRI? Maybe just a web page? We've talked about metadata in the <head>, and you could also standardize on machine-readable body html. It's almost a shame that RDF apps would need to parse HTML, but on the other hand, using github for hosting those entity IRIs, it's gotta return HTML anyhow since there's no content negotiation.

- chatgpt:

Given that you're using different IRIs for entities and datasets, and you're hosting them on platforms like GitHub where content negotiation isn't available, a **hybrid approach** combining **HTML web pages** with embedded **machine-readable metadata** could work well. Here’s a practical strategy for discoverability:

### 1. **HTML as the Primary Content**
The entity IRI (e.g., `https://example.org/BartSimpson`) can resolve to a simple **web page** that provides:
- **Human-readable information** about the entity (Bart Simpson).
- **Embedded metadata** in the `<head>` using JSON-LD, RDFa, or similar, ensuring that RDF-aware applications can still extract semantic data without parsing the HTML body extensively.

Example for `https://example.org/BartSimpson`:
```html
<html>
<head>
    <title>Bart Simpson</title>
    <script type="application/ld+json">
    {
      "@context": "http://schema.org",
      "@type": "Person",
      "name": "Bart Simpson",
      "sameAs": [
        "https://example.org/datasets/BartSimpson"
      ]
    }
    </script>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Bart Simpson</h1>
    <p>This page provides details about Bart Simpson, a fictional character from The Simpsons.</p>
    <p>Explore related datasets: <a href="https://example.org/datasets/BartSimpson">Bart Simpson Dataset</a></p>
</body>
</html>
```

This setup:
- **Human-friendly**: Displays entity information for typical web users.
- **Machine-readable**: Embeds RDF via JSON-LD or RDFa in the `<head>` so RDF apps can process the structured data.
- **Linked datasets**: Provides a clear link to the dataset IRI (`https://example.org/datasets/BartSimpson`) in both the **body** for humans and the **metadata** for machines.

### 2. **Embedded Metadata in the `<head>`**:
Embedding machine-readable data in the `<head>` section allows RDF-aware applications to extract information without needing to parse HTML. For example, you can use:
- **JSON-LD** (for its simplicity and wide adoption).
- **RDFa** (for directly embedding RDF within the HTML).

### 3. **Machine-Readable HTML Body**:
Though parsing HTML body content isn’t ideal for RDF apps, you can **standardize your HTML output** with structured elements (like `microdata` or well-defined classes) that make it easier for parsers to extract data if necessary. For example:
```html
<div itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Person">
    <span itemprop="name">Bart Simpson</span>
    <link itemprop="sameAs" href="https://example.org/datasets/BartSimpson">
</div>
```

This provides **redundant but accessible metadata**, ensuring RDF-aware systems can work with the data, even if they need to extract it from the body.

### 4. **Discovery Through Data Catalogs**:
You can use **DCAT (Data Catalog Vocabulary)** to make the dataset discoverable. The IRI for the dataset itself (`https://example.org/datasets/BartSimpson`) can contain metadata about the dataset, following DCAT or similar vocabularies:
```turtle
<https://example.org/datasets/BartSimpson> a dcat:Dataset ;
    dct:title "Bart Simpson Dataset" ;
    dct:creator :MattGroening ;
    dcat:distribution <https://example.org/datasets/BartSimpson/dist/ttl> .
```

### 5. **Advantages of GitHub Hosting with HTML**:
Since GitHub primarily serves static HTML:
- **HTML-first**: Ensures that even users who land on the entity IRI will get a useful, human-readable page.
- **Embedded metadata**: Keeps RDF-aware apps functional without requiring sophisticated content negotiation mechanisms.
- **Scalability**: This method scales well, as each entity IRI can follow the same structure.

### Conclusion:
By delivering **HTML pages** enriched with **embedded RDF metadata**, you ensure both **human usability** and **machine readability**, even when content negotiation isn’t available. This strategy fits well with GitHub Pages and other static hosting platforms, offering flexibility for both web and RDF-based applications.

Does this solution fit your needs, or would you like to dive deeper into any specific part?

## RDF only available at "dist" IRI-URLs

- dave:

I think this approach will work. Let's switch the example from Bart to me. So my IRI is https://djradon.github.io/dave-richardson - it returns HTML pointing to my dataset and catalog distributions, which maybe should have IRIs themselves, but more imporantly, have distribution URLs. <dave-richardson/default/current/dist/> is a "pointer IRI" that refers to my "default" dataset distributions, which should all represent the same data in different formats, and which are individually pointers, e.g. <dave-richardson/default/current/dist/ttl> to a versioned dataset IRI, e.g. <dave-richardson/default/v1/dist/ttl>. By convention, the default dataset for a Thing should contain references to any data catalogs (which are also datasets), so follow the same convention, e.g. <dave-richardson/default-catalog/v1/dist/ttl>

- chatgpt:

Your approach using **pointer IRIs** to manage dataset and catalog distributions looks solid and provides a clear structure. Let’s break it down using your example for **https://djradon.github.io/dave-richardson**.

### Structure for Dataset and Catalog Distributions

1. **IRI for the Person (you)**:
   - **https://djradon.github.io/dave-richardson**: This URL will point to an HTML page that contains information about you, Dave Richardson, and provides links to both the dataset and data catalogs. The HTML page will serve both human-readable content and machine-readable metadata using RDFa or JSON-LD.

2. **Pointer IRI for Default Dataset Distributions**:
   - **<dave-richardson/default/current/dist/>**: This "pointer IRI" refers to the **default dataset** distributions (current version) in various formats. Each of these distributions represents the **same data** in different formats like Turtle, JSON-LD, etc.
   - Example of formats:
     - **<dave-richardson/default/current/dist/ttl>**: Points to the **Turtle version** of the default dataset.
     - **<dave-richardson/default/current/dist/jsonld>**: Points to the **JSON-LD version** of the default dataset.

3. **Versioned Dataset IRIs**:
   Each pointer to a format, like `<dave-richardson/default/current/dist/ttl>`, should in turn point to the **specific versioned dataset**:
   - **<dave-richardson/default/v1/dist/ttl>**: A specific versioned Turtle dataset.
   - You can increment these versions as needed (e.g., `v2`, `v3`, etc.).

4. **Pointer IRI for Data Catalog**:
   - **<dave-richardson/default-catalog/current/dist/>**: This IRI refers to the current distribution of your **default catalog**. Like datasets, the catalog can exist in multiple formats:
     - **<dave-richardson/default-catalog/current/dist/ttl>**: Points to the **Turtle version** of the catalog.
     - **<dave-richardson/default-catalog/v1/dist/ttl>**: Points to a specific version of the catalog.

5. **Discoverability via HTML and Metadata**:
   - The **HTML page** at `https://djradon.github.io/dave-richardson` can contain links and metadata pointing to these datasets and catalogs. Here’s a possible structure for embedding the metadata:
     ```html
     <html>
     <head>
         <title>Dave Richardson</title>
         <script type="application/ld+json">
         {
             "@context": "http://schema.org",
             "@type": "Person",
             "name": "Dave Richardson",
             "dataset": [
                 {
                     "@id": "https://djradon.github.io/dave-richardson/default/current/dist/ttl",
                     "name": "Turtle Dataset",
                     "distribution": "https://djradon.github.io/dave-richardson/default/v1/dist/ttl"
                 },
                 {
                     "@id": "https://djradon.github.io/dave-richardson/default-catalog/current/dist/ttl",
                     "name": "Catalog Distribution",
                     "distribution": "https://djradon.github.io/dave-richardson/default-catalog/v1/dist/ttl"
                 }
             ]
         }
         </script>
     </head>
     <body>
         <h1>Dave Richardson</h1>
         <p>This page provides links to my datasets and catalogs.</p>
         <ul>
             <li><a href="https://djradon.github.io/dave-richardson/default/current/dist/ttl">Turtle Dataset</a></li>
             <li><a href="https://djradon.github.io/dave-richardson/default-catalog/current/dist/ttl">Catalog Distribution</a></li>
         </ul>
     </body>
     </html>
     ```

### Summary:
- **Entity IRI**: `https://djradon.github.io/dave-richardson` returns HTML with links to datasets and catalogs.
- **Pointer IRIs**: `default/current/dist/` points to the latest version of the dataset in various formats.
- **Versioned IRIs**: Versioned datasets (e.g., `default/v1/dist/ttl`) maintain a history of changes.
- **Metadata in `<head>`**: Use JSON-LD to include machine-readable metadata in the HTML header for RDF apps.

This method ensures that both human users and RDF applications can easily access and navigate through your data catalogs and datasets.

Would you like to explore any further details or tweaks to this setup?


## Seems promising. maybe we'll dispense with default-catalog. Things need to be discoverable purely through RDF too, so maybe we make a set of file "index.ttl", "index.jsonld", etc available at the root to get things started.


Your idea of dispensing with the **default-catalog** and making a set of files like `index.ttl`, `index.jsonld`, etc., available at the root for discoverability through RDF is a practical solution. Here's how you could implement it:

### 1. **Root-Level Discovery Files**:
Providing **index files** (`index.ttl`, `index.jsonld`, etc.) at the root of your IRI namespace allows RDF-aware systems to start from a known entry point. These files can provide pointers to datasets, distributions, and other relevant resources.

Example of `index.ttl`:
```turtle
@prefix dcat: <http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#> .
@prefix dct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/> .

<https://djradon.github.io/dave-richardson/index.ttl> a dcat:Dataset ;
    dct:title "Index of Dave Richardson's Datasets" ;
    dcat:distribution <https://djradon.github.io/dave-richardson/default/current/dist/ttl> ;
    dcat:distribution <https://djradon.github.io/dave-richardson/default/current/dist/jsonld> ;
    dcat:distribution <https://djradon.github.io/dave-richardson/default/v1/dist/ttl> .
```

This **index file** provides the first entry point for RDF applications, listing the available datasets and distributions in Turtle and JSON-LD formats.

### 2. **File Naming Conventions**:
By adopting clear file naming conventions, you make it easy to navigate between different versions and formats. Here’s a breakdown of how files could be structured:
- `index.ttl`, `index.jsonld`: For the initial discovery of resources.
- `default/current/dist/ttl`, `default/current/dist/jsonld`: Points to the latest version of the dataset.
- `default/v1/dist/ttl`, `default/v1/dist/jsonld`: Specific versioned datasets.

### 3. **Self-Descriptive RDF Files**:
Each file (`index.ttl`, `index.jsonld`, etc.) can include self-descriptive metadata that points to its purpose and other related resources. This way, both RDF and non-RDF-aware systems can start from the **root IRI** and navigate to all necessary datasets, catalogs, and distributions.

### 4. **Discoverability**:
This approach ensures that everything is **discoverable purely through RDF** by using standard vocabularies like **DCAT** and **Dublin Core Terms (DCT)**. RDF clients can start with any of the **index files** and follow the links to the appropriate datasets.

Example of how this works:
- A client retrieves `https://djradon.github.io/dave-richardson/index.ttl`.
- From there, it discovers links to the Turtle, JSON-LD, and other versions of the dataset (`default/current/dist/ttl`, etc.).
- The client can follow the links to retrieve the actual data in the desired format.

### 5. **Serving the Human-Readable HTML**:
You can still serve a **human-readable HTML page** at the root IRI (`https://djradon.github.io/dave-richardson`), but the RDF files (`index.ttl`, `index.jsonld`) will ensure that everything is also **machine-readable**.

This approach ensures both RDF and human users can access and navigate your datasets easily. Does this seem like a solid direction for your project?
