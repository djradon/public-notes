## OK, what do you call a node/entity (what's it's Class name) that just represents a datatype, e.g. a string, so that you can make statements about strings. "datatype reifier" seems less than ideal because reification is overloaded already and not obvious anyhow.

A node or entity in RDF that represents a datatype (e.g., a string) and allows you to make statements about that datatype is typically referred to as a **"value resource"** or **"literal proxy"**. This kind of node serves as an intermediary resource that stands in for the literal so that additional properties can be attached to it. Since "reifier" is indeed a loaded term in RDF, these alternatives focus more on the role of representing a value as a resource in its own right.

Here are some naming options you might consider:

### 1. **Literal Proxy**:
   - **Description**: A class that represents a proxy for a literal value, allowing the literal to be treated as a resource to which you can attach properties.
   - **Why?**: This term emphasizes the idea that the literal is being "proxied" by a resource, making it clear that the value is being represented indirectly.
   - **Example**: You could define a `LiteralProxy` class that wraps strings, numbers, or other literals, allowing you to make statements about them.

### 2. **Value Resource**:
   - **Description**: A resource that stands in place of a literal value and allows statements to be made about the value.
   - **Why?**: "Value resource" suggests that the node is a resource representing a specific value (literal), which is a natural extension of how RDF resources work.
   - **Example**: You could create instances of `ValueResource` to represent strings, numbers, or other literals that you want to describe in greater detail.

### 3. **Data Entity**:
   - **Description**: A class that represents a structured data entity, which allows literals to be treated as first-class citizens in the RDF graph.
   - **Why?**: "Data entity" focuses on the idea that the literal is treated as a full-fledged entity in the graph, making it clear that it's not a raw literal but a representational object.
   - **Example**: `DataEntity` could be used for strings or numbers where additional metadata or properties are needed.

### 4. **Value Node**:
   - **Description**: A node in the RDF graph that represents a literal value.
   - **Why?**: This term captures the idea that the node is standing in for a literal, emphasizing its role as a point in the graph that connects the literal to other statements.
   - **Example**: A `ValueNode` class could allow you to make additional statements about specific string literals, such as their language or context.

### 5. **Literal Resource**:
   - **Description**: A class that represents a literal value as a resource, enabling further properties to be attached to it.
   - **Why?**: This term directly conveys that the literal is being represented as a resource, emphasizing its RDF role as something that can be linked to other entities.
   - **Example**: `LiteralResource` could allow a string or number to be the subject of additional properties like source or format.

### 6. **ValueWrapper**:
   - **Description**: A wrapper class for values (literals), enabling them to be treated as full resources.
   - **Why?**: "Wrapper" emphasizes that the node is encapsulating a literal, making it suitable for further description.
   - **Example**: `ValueWrapper` instances could be used for numbers or strings when you need to describe their properties.

### Example Use Case:
If you wanted to describe a specific string (e.g., "Hello, world!") and add properties to it, you might define a class `LiteralProxy` like this:

```turtle
_:string1 a :LiteralProxy ;
          :hasValue "Hello, world!" ;
          :language "en" ;
          :source "Generated by User" .
```

In this case, `_:string1` is an instance of `LiteralProxy` (or whichever term you prefer), and the actual string "Hello, world!" is attached as a property (`:hasValue`), along with other descriptive properties.

### Conclusion:
While "datatype reifier" might seem technically correct, it's not ideal due to the baggage around "reification" in RDF. Terms like **Literal Proxy**, **Value Resource**, or **Literal Resource** are cleaner, more intuitive alternatives that clearly communicate the idea of representing literals as resources for further description.


## which do you like best? Literal Proxy might be my favorite

I think **[[t.cs.semantic-web.literal-proxy]]** is a great choice! It's clear, intuitive, and communicates exactly what the node is doingâ€”standing in for a literal in a way that allows you to make statements about it. It avoids the complexities and connotations of "reification" while emphasizing the role of the proxy as an intermediary resource. It strikes a balance between technical accuracy and ease of understanding. Let me know if you need any further refinements!
