## Summary

- There are three ideal properties you want from a good naming system:
  -   **Secure.** The name reliably points to what it is supposed to, and not to an imposter.
  -   **Decentralized**. there is no central authority in the naming system that can fail, or be corrupted.
  -   **Human-meaningful**. The name makes sense and is memorable. [gordonbrander.com](https://gordonbrander.com/), or [@gordonbrander](https://twitter.com/gordonbrander), for example.
