- memory-maker listens to your story, pulls out concepts; can listen to how others see you
- people, places, time, feelings, x, y
- makes a graph, like a concept heatmaps
- retells in different styles
- take memories and out and share them; the world becomes the source for your proxi
- the proxi can be "embodied", say, into a game of survivor with your friends;
- why a world? above a certain number of items, a zoomable spatial interface is much more usable. makes it more tangible; conceptual things are next to each other; 
- the more memories, the better? two-three dozen is where it gets useful; at 100 it tapered off. importance is well-served with the zoomable as well;
