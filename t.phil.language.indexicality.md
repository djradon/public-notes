## Description

- The modern concept originates in the semiotic theory of @charles-sanders-peirce, in which indexicality is one of the three fundamental sign modalities by which a sign relates to its referent (the others being iconicity and symbolism)
- Words and expressions in language often derive some part of their referential meaning from indexicality.
  - For example, I indexically refers to the entity that is speaking; now indexically refers to a time frame including the moment at which the word is spoken; and here indexically refers to a locational frame including the place where the word is spoken.
  - Linguistic expressions that refer indexically are known as deictics
