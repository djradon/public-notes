  - a single application can't scale to that level of complexity
  - a single company with a walled-garden approach can't make all the right decisions, i.e., it has to happen organically
  - metaverse "a honeypot trap for 'architecture astronauts.'"
    - "high-level" stuff isn't important for getting stuff built

  - "Sometimes these things that just add people are not always a positive, especially for people that are a little more on the introverted side of things."
  - shouldn't be built around 3D models and recreations of physical objects, since that throws out too much assets, and places a high barrier to entry for people with cameras
