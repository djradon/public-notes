## Highlights

### Two Fundamental Questions of Scenario Structure

- What do the characters do?
- How do the players do it?

#### Example

- a very different game structure than the traditional D&D dungeoncrawl:

**Player**: I want to explore the dungeon.

**GM**: Okay, make a Dungeoneering check.

**Player**: I succeed.

**GM**: Okay, you kill a tribe of goblins and emerge with 546 gp in loot.

- that example already assumes that the PCs are fantasy heroes who do things like dungeoncrawling. Given the exact same setting and the exact same game system, they could just as easily be monarchs, dragons, farmers, magical researchers, planar travelers, gods, military masterminds, or any of a dozen other things for whom these dungeoncrawling game structures are irrelevant.
