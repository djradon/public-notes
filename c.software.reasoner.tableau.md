The core principle of tableau reasoning involves the following steps:

    Representation of Logical Expressions: The reasoner represents the logical expressions or statements (such as those in an ontology) in a structured form, often as a tree or a set of interconnected nodes.

    Expansion Rules: The tableau method applies a series of expansion rules to these expressions. These rules systematically break down complex expressions into simpler components.

    Branching: The process often involves creating branches in the tableau, each representing different scenarios or interpretations of the logic. For example, if an expression contains a disjunction (an "or" statement), the tableau might branch into two paths, one for each part of the disjunction.

    Checking for Contradictions: The reasoner checks each branch for contradictions. A branch is closed (considered unsatisfiable) if it contains a contradiction.

    Satisfiability Determination: If at least one branch of the tableau remains open (without contradictions), the original set of expressions is considered satisfiable. If all branches are closed, the expressions are unsatisfiable.

In the context of ontologies and semantic web technologies, tableau-based reasoners are used to check the consistency of ontologies, to infer implicit knowledge, and to classify entities in the ontology. They are particularly well-suited for expressive logic languages like OWL DL and OWL 2, which require sophisticated reasoning capabilities.

Examples of tableau-based reasoners include Pellet, HermiT, and Fact++. These reasoners are integral to many applications in the semantic web, artificial intelligence, and knowledge management, where they help to automate the process of reasoning about complex and interconnected data.
