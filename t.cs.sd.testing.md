### 
- "Rather than thinking of tests along the traditional unit / integration / end-to-end spectrum, I think it's helpful to think along a few other dimensions

    is this test fast or slow?
    is this a black-box test or a white-box test?
    is this test informed by development or does it inform development?
"
