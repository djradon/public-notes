  - "Some might argue that TIGER Webservices are too “loose” and do not adhere to any “recognized” standard. You’re right, they don’t, and for good reason. I don’t like the standards I’ve seen and used. They suck. So I don’t use them. As an application architect, I write my own. And so can you. You don’t have to use some wonky outdated standard just because everyone else does."
