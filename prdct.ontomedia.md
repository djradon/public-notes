## Motivation

- The OntoMedia project began as a convergence of three interests - the creation of metadata to describe the content of online amateur fiction, the identification of events in multimedia objects to seed external applications such as sound effects or automatic music generation and, finally, as a potential way of generating narrative
- From that beginning it has expanded to describe narrative in media

## Issues

- namespace URI squatted, ontologies not available!?
