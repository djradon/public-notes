## Highlights

1. PMs don't control Engineers
2. Engineers make product deciions
3. Product managers give engineers context
 - Analyze product analytics
 - Investigate opportunities
 - Do competitor research
 - Conduct user research (although engineers should still talk to users)
 - Share industry news
 - Track the results of the team's work
4. Accountability through feedback loops
  a. Product engineers set their own quarterly goals
  We used to do OKRs and metric-based goals, but we ran into two problems with it:
  - Teams wasted too much time coming up with the right metric to focus on.
  -  focused on small quick wins to move those metrics, rather than building what our users actually wanted.
  b. Product managers run monthly growth reviews
5. Learn fast by optimizing for speed
