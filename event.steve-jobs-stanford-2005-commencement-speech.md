- [[p.attributedTo]] @steve-jobs

- believe that your dots will connect, because that will allow you to take chances
- the only way to do great work is to love what you do; don't settle
- you'll be dead soon; don't be trapped by dogma; stay hungry; stay foolish

## thoughts

- privileged
  - it's easy for a billionaire to take chances and "start fresh"
  - it's easy for a kid with nothing to lose to start a company in his parents' garage
  - it's easy for a fortunate genius to make a living doing what she loves
