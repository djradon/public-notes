    -   Svelte is a UI framework _and_ a compiler and therefore ships minimal code without a client runtime;
    -   Svelte has an expressive templating language and component system (personal preference);
    -   Svelte includes global stores, transitions and animations out of the box, which means: no decision fatigue choosing a global state management toolkit and an animation library;
    -   Svelte supports scoped CSS in single-file-components;
    -   SvelteKit supports SSR, simple but flexible file-based routing and server-side routes for building an API;
    -   SvelteKit allows for each page to run code on the server, e.g. to fetch data that is used to render the page;
    -   Layouts shared across routes;
    -   SvelteKit can be run in a serverless environment.
