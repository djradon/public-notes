## Rationale

### addresses “Swollen Controller Problem.”
-   **Simplifying Concepts**: It provides a clear structure for REST API endpoints, focusing on the essential components.
-   **Reducing Controller Complexity**: Unlike traditional MVC controllers, which can become bloated, the REPR pattern encourages smaller controllers dedicated to specific endpoints.
-   **Enforcing Clarity**: By adhering to the REPR pattern, developers maintain a clear separation of concerns, leading to more maintainable and extensible APIs.
