Space Station 14 is inspired by the cult classic Space Station 13 and tells the extraordinary story of everything that can go wrong on a shift at a space station. You take on a role and complete your tasks so that the space station doesn't go to the dogs... or do the exact opposite. Prepare yourself for chaos and the finest roleplay. Best of all, SS14 is open-source and anyone can play!
