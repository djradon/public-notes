## Historical Context

Cuis is a kernel Smalltalk system which is still rather close to Smalltalk-80. The Cuis-Smalltalk goal is to be a small, coherent Smalltalk development environment that, with study, is comprehensible to a single person.

As we experiment with and evolve Cuis, this goal is carried out by removing everything possible from the base system which is not essential, and by having a composition strategy which allows one to write or add any features as needed. As one gains understanding of the software kernel or core, one only has to read and learn from each additional feature at a time to understand the whole.

Modern, open software environments are highly complex. Cuis is an attempt to remain oriented and able to discover patterns without being lost in a large wealth of possibilities which one does not completely grasp
