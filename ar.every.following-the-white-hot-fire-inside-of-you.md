- [[c.quotes]]
  - All grumbling is tantamount to ‘Oh, why is a lily not an oak?’
  - "set reminders to look at the reminders"
  - "I don’t make art. I make things. Framing it like that keeps what I’m doing from becoming precious. And that’s a good thing, because to be precious is to be timid—and that’s bad."
  - Creativity requires attention to detail and persistence in the face of failure: that’s why it’s called a “discipline.”
