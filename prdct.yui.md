- YUI is developed in-house at Yahoo and features extensive, high-quality documentation and examples. Designed for speed and targeted at a population of professional PHP developers, YUI is designed with the needs of Yahoo-scale applications in mind. A growing list of controls is available with the toolkit as are useful CSS normalizing and layout style sheets. No package system is available, but “roll up” files of common functionality are distributed and documentation makes clear what order to load files in. No CSS query or markup-driven widget construction system is available in YUI. YUI has an active community and liberal licensing but external committers are not allowed on the project and Yahoo has not clarified the code lineage and other IP rights around the toolkit. No source control access of any sort is available. YUI is edge-cached on Yahoo’s CDN for use by all.
