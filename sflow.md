## Features

- use github or gitlab to manage namespaces using [[sflow.concepts.namespace-repo]] and mint IRIs
- copy scan IRI sources,  

## Requirements



## Relationship with Kosmion

- [[ko]] is a unorthodox, relator-based foundational ontology developed side-by-side with Semantic Flow. 
- hopefully Semantic Flow has no dependencies on Kosmion and can be used for any kind of RDF data
