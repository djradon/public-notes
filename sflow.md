## Features

- use github or gitlab to manage namespaces and mint IRIs
- scan [[IRI sources|sflow.concepts.namespace-repo]]

## Requirements

- for [[dereference pages|sflow.concepts.dereference-pages]] you don't want all assertions, only some of the most useful ones, perhaps with links to where you can get more
- mapping of templates to facets, namespaces, datasets, sparql queries


## Relationship with Kosmion

- [[ko]] is a unorthodox, relator-based foundational ontology developed side-by-side with Semantic Flow. 
- hopefully Semantic Flow has no dependencies on Kosmion and can be used for any kind of RDF data
