- ideally there could be some kind of signature that affirms "the dataset published to this IRI was authorized by a person who has control of the namespace" but I guess its existance at that URL speaks for itself.
- see [[sflow.conv.2024-10-25-semantic-flow-overview#authority]] for approaches to trust

### Dereference Pages

- for [[Reference Pages|sflow.concepts.reference-pages]] you don't want all assertions, only some of the most useful ones, perhaps with links to where you can get more (ie., catalog links)
- mapping of templates to facets, namespaces, datasets, sparql queries

- optionally, you can use
