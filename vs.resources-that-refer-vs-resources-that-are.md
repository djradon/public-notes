- notes that refer to actual things (sites, people, books, articles) could be called
  - reference notes
  - resource notes
  - could further differentiate notes that refer to topics / abstract things


## Notes (in the Dendron sense)

- differentiate between notes that represent something (e.g. topics, solutions) and notes that are something (vs, journal)
  - comes down to "is about" something vs "is (a literary) something"?
    - could come down to resources being terms (instead of topics) [[vs.terms-vs-topics]]
      - and contextual terms at that
    - literary because the only things that refer to something and also are the something they refer to (self-referentiality) are
      - literature
      - symbols
      - computer programs (and some pointers?)
      - maybe logical statement
  - using `type` for both seems wrong 
  - article is interesting b/c it can be both
  - this is different that the class-individual confusion
  - how much does it really matter?
  - I guess resources that are something are just a special case (subset)  of the resources that represent something  ^AQ6h3rFksAfc

## URIs / URLS

- easier to judge from context: is the domain/range of the predicate a IRI? If not, it's about the thing the subject/object IRI refers to
