## Highlights

- “…there  is  just  one  material  cat  out  there  in  the  world—the  “noumenal”  cat  which  exists whether the subject perceives it or not.  When the subject or the external observer looks at the noumenal cat, it is a phenomenal cat that they see. So we have a cat itself (the noumenal cat) whose  existence  and  nature  is  observer-independent,  and  a  seen  (phenomenal)  cat  that represents the noumenal cat, whose existence and nature is observer-dependent.  In everyday life we usually think of the cat we see as a “physical cat” and, for the purposes of everyday life, we usually treat it as being the cat itself rather than a representation of the cat itself.  But this does not double the number of actual cats, not does it ‘smear’ any additional phenomenal cats all  over  the  noumenal  cat.  Rather,  the one,  noumenal  cat  has  as  many  numerically  distinct appearances as there are views of it by individual observers.” (Velmans, 2008, p41) ^2a0y73y0gq9x

- “... strictly speaking ...it is always the cat itself that one is looking at although it is a 
phenomenal cat that one sees, which makes the phenomenal cat the observation and the 
cat itself the observed. In everyday life we blur these distinctions for the reason that we 
habitually treat phenomenal objects to be the observed objects for the reason that this is 
how those objects appear to us. I will return to some of these distinctions below, when they 
become important to the issues under discussion—and I have unravelled them in depth in 
Velmans (2000) chapters 6, 7, and 8.”  (Ibid, p10, note 7)
