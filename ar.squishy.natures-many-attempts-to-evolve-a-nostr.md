## Highlights

- [[prdct.nostr]] is [[t.cs.sd.architecture.relay]]: ^1fayi8skch8g
  -   **Relays are simple**. They use boring technology, like plain old servers. You benefit from all of the tailwinds of traditional app development.
      
  -   **Relays take advantage of economies of scale**. Big dumb servers in the cloud have high availability and high uptime, and they’re commodity infrastructure.
      
  -   **Relays sidestep the N^2 scaling problem**: Relays don’t talk to each other, and users only need to join a few relays, and will probably join less than a dozen. We never really hit the scale where the n^2 scaling problem matters.
      
  -   **Relays support user-ownership**. Users own their data, own their account, and most importantly, [they own their keys](https://newsletter.squishy.computer/p/the-minimal-definition-of-user-agency). If a relay goes down or shuts you down, no problem! Your account doesn’t change, and your data is mirrored to other relays. [Credible exit](https://newsletter.squishy.computer/p/credible-exit)!
