- Transitional Design
  - best of both worlds
  - transitions
    - object permanence
- hotwire
  - rails
  - github
    - history api to do client-side navigation
    - partial html updates -> inconsistency everywhere
  - svelte with vite
- truth is nuanced

- embraces mpa

## supabase

- cloudified postgresql
- supports GraphQL

## sanity.io

- structured content as data
- webhooks
- cool model! github needs webhooks
- "[portable text](https://github.com/portabletext/portabletext)" #json #not-for-humans
