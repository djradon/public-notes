## Highlights

- "The issue with the DL approach to FOL fragments is that the operator-subset approach is too coarse grained. We need something more finegrained that allowes for syntactic and semantic constraints over the specific interpretations and theories. An example of such an approach is stratified negation in datalog. DL would simply ban negation or recursion, but limiting the syntax of datalog programs allows for correct semantics while still allowing solutions for many interesting problems."

### Real world knowledge is quite messy

- Real world knowledge is quite messy and riddled with exceptions. 
  - People from cultures without a last name. 
  - A stump is still a tree in the right context, even if it doesn't have a crown. 
  - A character in D&D might have traits that are completely uncommon for their class. 
  - The greek gods for sleep, death or the night sky are both concepts and characters.

### Theory vs Interpretation

- @paul-houle: "The theory vs interpretation split is another one of those decisions you have to make if you want to do logic: I am on a committee where I'm the guy who speaks for interpretations and the A-Box but some of the other people are serious T-Boxers."
