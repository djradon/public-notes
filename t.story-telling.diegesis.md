**Diegesis** is a term used in narrative theory and film studies to refer to the narrative world in which the story takes place. It encompasses everything that exists within the fictional universe of the story, including characters, events, objects, and settings.

### Key Aspects of Diegesis:

1. **Diegetic Elements**:
   - These are the elements that are part of the story world itself. If a character in a film hears music playing on the radio, that music is diegetic because it exists within the narrative world. Similarly, dialogue between characters, sounds made by objects or actions in the story, and anything else that the characters can perceive are considered diegetic.

2. **Non-Diegetic Elements**:
   - These elements are not part of the story world and are intended only for the audience. Examples include background music (soundtrack), voice-over narration (when the narrator is not a character within the story), or text that appears on the screen to provide context (like subtitles or credits). The characters in the story are unaware of non-diegetic elements.

3. **Diegetic vs. Non-Diegetic**:
   - Understanding the distinction between diegetic and non-diegetic elements is crucial in analyzing how a story is told. In film, for example, a non-diegetic soundtrack might influence the mood of a scene without the characters being aware of it, while diegetic sounds or music can have an impact on the characters themselves.

### Example in Film:
- **Diegetic**: A character playing a song on a guitar within a movie. The character and other characters in the scene can hear it, and it exists within the film's world.
- **Non-Diegetic**: The orchestral score playing in the background during an action sequence. The audience hears it, but the characters do not.

### Diegesis in Literature:
In literary theory, diegesis refers to the world of the story as it is narrated by the narrator. The term is often contrasted with "mimesis," which refers to the imitation or representation of reality in art. Diegesis involves the recounting of events and descriptions, while mimesis involves showing events through dialogue or direct action.

### Summary:
Diegesis is the term used to describe the narrative world in which the story unfolds
