  - Don’t ask “what are the dependencies in my system?” as this is a generic question that makes sense in any system, and hence, has little value. Instead, ask something like: “are there dependencies between these two modules I want to split that do not go through the designated API?” This question is about something contextual (those two modules), it has direct value (you want to split them) and is specifying what is interesting and what is not (API and non-API dependencies).
