- RDFS is NOT about specifying what values class instances should have, it is ONLY about classifying resources based on the values they do have.
  - "I recommend using domains and ranges only if you want to discover class membership of your resources based on their data. And, of course, if the environment you use the ontology in offers RDFS reasoning." [[ar.topquadrant.why-i-use-shacl-for-defining-ontology-models]]
