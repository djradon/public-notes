## Thoughts

- somewhat unsatisfying so far after ~20-30min of play. 
  - abstract map contributes to lack of overientation
  - there's a single world-seed per chapter, but otherwise no player interaction/tension
  - combat is abstracted away and not very engaging
  - could benefit from more player agency/choices that have meaningful consequences
  - navigation is confusing
  - why would i care about other players posts?
  - not clear about search vs explore
