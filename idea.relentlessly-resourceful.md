## [[c.Highlight]]

- "To be hapless is to be battered by circumstancesâ€”to let the world have its way with you, instead of having your way with the world."
- "This isn't the recipe for success in writing or painting, for example. In that kind of work the recipe is more to be actively curious. Resourceful implies the obstacles are external, which they generally are in startups. But in writing and painting they're mostly internal; the obstacle is your own obtuseness."
  - not sure I agree.
