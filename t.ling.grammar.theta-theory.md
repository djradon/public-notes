- Theta theory addresses the specific semantic relationships between a verb and its arguments. Verbs assign thematic roles (theta roles) to each NP that is obligatory (must be included in the verb phrase). Theta theory requires that theta criterion be fulfilled in order for a verb to used grammatically.
