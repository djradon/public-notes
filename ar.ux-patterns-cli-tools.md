- [[p.hasSummaryPoints]]
  - implement interactive usage modes
  - [[p.wasInspirationFor]] using shell instead of mattermost
  - you can even have beautiful animated charts if you use libraries like Go’s termui
  - favourite part of walking into a treadmill is watching the completion indicator move forward to the right
  - Using exit codes correctly is elementary because it allows your users to combine your tool with others’ and write useful scripts to automate their tasks.
  - Like having an interactive shell, having consistent sub-commands is excellent for discoverability. When you have a consistent command tree, users can guess how to do things.
