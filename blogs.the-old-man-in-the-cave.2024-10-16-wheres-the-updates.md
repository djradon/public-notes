## Has it been two weeks already?

Actually, it's been closer to three weeks since my [first post](https://theoldmaninthecave.substack.com/p/lets-reboot-the-semantic-web-with-alternate-realities).

Those ~900 words were so agonized that I'm still recovering. But I also wanted to focus on getting some work done that was worth writing about. I've been going from minus one to zero for long enough already!

But I do want dev journal to be somewhat-regular even when progress is slow. So I'm going to lower my standards and just publicize some learnings, goddammit.


## Let Me Just Open the Preferred GUI...

I'd been composing little bits of RDF in my favorite editor, [[prdct.vscode]]


## Enter Kosmion

I'd wanted to write a lot of backstory on the limitations of the [[t.cs.semantic-web]] to set up the announcement of my hero's quest: a new methodology and foundational ontology that will revolutionize all the things. But I'll just skip to the chase.
