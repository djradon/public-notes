## Thoughts

- `!` used for BREAKING CHANGE
  - `!` could be used in [[proj.GraphDown]] for emphasizing tags, predicates, or objects  ^cN92w9TjfnXM
    - hard to imagine the need to emphasize an subject but I suppose 
      - (since subjects are ultimately equivalent to objects related with an inverse predicate)
    - emphasis could denote "default" or preferred properties
- always at the start, understandably... 
  - but
    - if you treated them as tags, you could include them at the end, or anywhere internal
