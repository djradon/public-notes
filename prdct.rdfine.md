## Features

- RDFine greatly simplifies the manipulation of data in RDF graph (RDF/JS datasets) by wrapping low-level node handling of triples in plain JavaScript objects.
- While plain JS objects are the preferred way to access the graphs, they do not completely replace the underlying RDF/JS dataset. Both RDFine objects and the dataset can be modified simultaneously, with changes to one immediately reflected in the other.
- RDFine makes it super easy to bootstrap a triple-backed project without the need to drink up the RDF Kool-Aid. Novices will use the idiomatic JS interface to get the job done quickly, while power users still can take advantage of seamless integration with @rdfjs libraries.
- because JavaScript [[mixins|t.cs.sd.mixin]] are used, "multiple inheritance" is possible
