  - Sometimes, you simply want to have all of your shared methods exist flat on the same object as you would get with inheritance.
    - But with P.A.I.L restrictions: 
      - private
        - You are using inheritance purely for code reuse, not for public hierarchies.
      - base classes abstract
      - Isolate your base and child classes. Your base and child classes should be completely oblivious of the properties the other class provides. A child class should never override a base classâ€™s methods or even access a property inherited from the base class, and a base class should never expect a child class to provide a missing method implementation
      - last resort. Only use restricted inheritance when no other options are good enough. Inheritance should be a dusty tool in the far corner of your tool shed
