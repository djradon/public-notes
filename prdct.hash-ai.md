## Features

- https://hash.ai/docs/simulation/concepts/designing-for-different-timescales
  - Expressing multiple timescales in a simulation is a difficult problem that exists across platforms and frameworks. Often you're forced to break your representation of time and just ignore the different timescales.
    - There are a couple of different ways you can solve this problem in HASH. Common approaches are:
      - Add discrete event features to signal when agents should pause to allow for different computation times
      - Add delays to normalize the actions across timescales.

- The hCore API provides read and write access to the code and contents of simulation projects. This access can be used, amongst other things, to change the logic of a simulation based on external changes offline or in response to user-input outside of HASH. This unlocks the creation of domain-specific and custom user interfaces for building HASH models.
