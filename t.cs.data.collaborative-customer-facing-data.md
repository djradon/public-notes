## Description

**Collaborative:** Users/Customers are likely to be iteratively working with the data that is presented back to them. _“That’s great, but have you got it in blue?”_, that sort of thing. I wrote about iterative AI, \[[here](https://generativeai.pub/iterative-ai-in-the-generative-age-c697c81fb98b)\].

**Customer Facing Data:** Our customers are interfacing with our solution because they want something. Maybe their bank balance, maybe legal documents or advice, maybe holiday suggestions or available seats in a cinema. We might think it is our data, but customers want it to be their data. They are only interested in customer facing data, not the data we sell to third parties or hide behind their back. They want service and they want to feel important.
