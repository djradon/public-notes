## Features

- vvvv programs are compiled and run on the .NET virtual machine. As such they are as fast as if youâ€™d write them in C#.
  - Modify your program while it is running, compilation happens in the background.
- vvvv can be extended with custom nodes written in pure C#. No proprietary plugin-wrapping boilerplate code is needed.
