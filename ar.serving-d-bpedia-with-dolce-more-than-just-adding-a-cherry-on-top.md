## Abstract

Large knowledge bases, such as DBpedia, are most often cre- ated heuristically due to scalability issues. In the building process, both random as well as systematic errors may occur. In this paper, we focus on finding systematic errors, or anti-patterns, in DBpedia. We show that by aligning the DBpedia ontology to the foundational ontology DOLCE- Zero, and by combining reasoning and clustering of the reasoning results, errors affecting millions of statements can be identified at a minimal workload for the knowledge base designer.
