## Features


    System:
        Free, open source
        Cross-platform: runs on Mac, Windows, Linux, et al
        International character set support
    Programming:
        Fully programmable
        Approachable syntax
        Language is Logo dialect extended to support agents
        Mobile agents (turtles) move over a grid of stationary agents (patches)
        Link agents connect turtles to make networks, graphs, and aggregates
        Large vocabulary of built-in language primitives
        Double precision floating point math
        First-class function values (aka anonymous procedures, closures, lambda)
        Runs are reproducible cross-platform
    Environment:
        Command center for on-the-fly interaction
        Interface builder w/ buttons, sliders, switches, choosers, monitors, text boxes, notes, output area
        Info tab for annotating your model with formatted text and images
        HubNet: participatory simulations using networked devices
        Agent monitors for inspecting and controlling agents
        Export and import functions (export data, save and restore state of model, make a movie)
        BehaviorSpace, an open source tool used to collect data from multiple parallel runs of a model
        System Dynamics Modeler
        NetLogo 3D for modeling 3D worlds
        Headless mode allows doing batch runs from the command line
    Display and visualization:
        Line, bar, and scatter plots
        Speed slider lets you fast forward your model or see it in slow motion
        View your model in either 2D or 3D
        Scalable and rotatable vector shapes
        Turtle and patch labels
    APIs:
        controlling API allows embedding NetLogo in a script or application
        extensions API allows adding new commands and reporters to the NetLogo language; open source example extensions are included
