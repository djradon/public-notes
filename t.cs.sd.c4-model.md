- [[p.hasHighlight]]
  -  To document a library, framework or SDK, you might be better off using something like UML
  -  Sometimes diagrams work better showing dependency relationships (e.g. uses, reads from, etc), and sometimes data flow (e.g. customer update events) works better.
     -  most relationships can be expressed either way, and the more explicit you can be, the better. For example, describing a relationship as "sends customer update events to" can be more descriptive than simply "customer update events".

## Issues

### Overly-prescriptive abstractions

- using domain-specific abstractions makes more sense than using arbitrary ones. Diagram authors benefit from thinking about each system on its own terms (and in its own terms). Diagram viewers do, too.
- The top-down, abstraction-first approach of C4 risks focusing too much on a systemâ€™s abstractions at the expense of its concrete resources.
