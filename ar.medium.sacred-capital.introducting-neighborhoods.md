  - We prefer to think in terms of “neighbourhoods” because, unlike platforms, neighbourhoods are not burdened by:
    - vendor lock-in
    - algorithms whose obscure operations dictate what we stumble upon
    - corporate-driven community guidelines
    - centralized storage of sensitive, interpersonal data and communication
      - (although to make a game fair, you can submit your information to a trustworty MCP)
