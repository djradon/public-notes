## Description

- "Epilog is similar to other logic programming languages, such as Datalog and Prolog, but there are some differences. Like Datalog, Epilog separates data and rules. Like Prolog, Epilog supports data and rules with functional terms. Like both of these languages, Epilog provides the ability to define views of data. However, Epilog also provides a way to express database dynamics. Whereas Prolog treats side effects implicitly using assert and retract as subgoals in view definitions, Epilog enables users to express side effects in the form of operations defined as database transformation"

## Benefits

### Programming Ease

- Easier to create and modify than traditional programs
  - Programmers can get by with little or no knowledge of the
  capabilities of systems executing those programs.
  - Less work. The specification is the program; no need to
  make choices about data structures and algorithms.
  - Easier to learn logic programming than traditional
programming. Think spreadsheets.
