## Highlights

- scalability requirements will push towards the use of automated methods to acquire, translate or merge ontologies. Such methods are known to degrade the level of formality of ontologies, resulting in the preva- lence of lightweight ontologies [3]. We believe that such limitation is fundamental rather than technical; we refer the reader to the paper of Elst and Abecker for a detailed treatment of the contradiction of sharing scope, stability and formality of knowledge in information systems [4]
