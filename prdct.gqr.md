## Features

- In contrast to other qualitative reasoners, it offers reasoning services for different calculi. These services are not hard-coded into the program. 
  - Both spatial calculi, e.g., RCC-5 and RCC-8, and temporal ones, like Allen's interval algebra, are supported. 
- New logics can be added to the system using a simple text format; no programming is necessary. 
- GQR is currently one of the best reasoning systems for qualitative calculi
