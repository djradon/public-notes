## Definition

- "any creative work, chiefly any narrative work, portraying individuals, events, or places that are imaginary or in ways that are imaginary."
- "In a traditional narrow sense, "fiction" refers to written narratives in prose â€“ often referring specifically to novels, novellas, and short stories. More broadly, however, fiction encompasses imaginary narratives expressed in any medium, including not just writings but also live theatrical performances, films, television programs, radio dramas, comics, role-playing games, and video games."
