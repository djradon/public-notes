## Features

- [temporal extensions](https://github.com/BFO-ontology/BFO-2020/blob/master/src/owl/profiles/temporal%20extensions/README.md)
  - Given the need to represent time and change in many domains and the wide use of OWL in ontology circles, proposals have been offered by users of BFO for representing such phenomena within the binary constraints of OWL. Examples include:

    -   [Temporalized Relations](https://github.com/BFO-ontology/BFO-2020/blob/master/src/owl/profiles/temporal%20extensions/temporalized%20relations/owl/README.md)
    -   [Temporal Interpretation Annotation](https://oborel.github.io/obo-relations/temporal-semantics/)
