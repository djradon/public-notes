## Example

Michelle Bachelet, position held, President of Chile, e1)
(e1, start date, 2014-03-11, default)
. . .
(Michelle Bachelet, position held, President of Chile, e2)
(e2, start date, 2006-03-11, default)

## Issues

- if we add
the qualifiers for both statements, then we would not know which start date pairs with which end
date, for example.
  - [[c.solution]] A proposed workaround involves adding intermediate nodes to denote different occurrences of quoted triples, but
this requires a reserved term 
    - @dean-allemang might say: "A held position/office isn’t some new thing I am inventing just to get around some deficiency in my modeling system; it’s actually the way people talk about holding public office."
