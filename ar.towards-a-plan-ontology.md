## Highlights

- the core activity mo del within this ontology draws on the <inova> (Issues-Nodes-Orderings/Variables/Auxiliary) constraint model of plans proposed recently to integrate a number of perspectives on plan and process representation
- A Plan is a Specialised Type of Design

### Principal Denition of a Plan
- a PLAN is a SPECIFICATION of BEHAVIOUR for some PURPOSE(s)
  - A PLAN may or maynot be EXECUTABLE
- BEHAVIOUR is something that one or more AGENTs PERFORM
- AGENT is an entity that can do one or both of the following:
  - PERFORM or participate in the PERFORMance of BEHAVIOUR 
    - It can be a supplier of force behind BEHAVIOUR
    - HOLD some PURPOSE(s)
- EXECUTABLE means a PLAN can be PERFORMed by some AGENT(s)
- PURPOSE is a CONSTRAINT which is HELD by one or more AGENTS
- CONSTRAINT is a RELATIONSHIP. It expresses an assertion that can be evaluated with respect to a given PLAN as something that may hold and can be elaborated in some language
- SPECIFICATION is a set of CONSTRAINTs
