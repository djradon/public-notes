Git submodules are a way to have another repository inside your own repository. All the benefits of code sharing, none of the fuss. Well, maybe some of the fuss. Because gitâ€™s implementation of submodules leaves something to be desired.

The first and most obvious problem with Submodules is when you pull f

```
git config --global submodule.recurse 
```

And second you may have to init the submodule once you clone the project onto another computer.

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

And even after this there does not appear to be a way to keep them pointed at the `HEAD` commit which makes committing to them a bit more difficult.
