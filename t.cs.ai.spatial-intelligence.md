Spatial intelligence in AI teaches systems to interpret, navigate, and manipulate aspects of the physical world.

### why spatial Intelligence is a challenge for AI?

-   **Ambiguity and Uncertainty**: Real-world environments contain uncertainties and variations in lighting, object appearances, and occlusions. AI systems must account for errors, inconsistencies, and missing data commonly found in real-world spatial datasets.
    
-   **Dynamic Nature:** The world is in constant flux, requiring AI models to adapt to changes in real time. Applications like self-driving cars or real-time drone navigation demand fast and accurate spatial data processing.
    
-   **Multimodal Data and its Complexity:** Spatial understanding often requires integrating information from sources like images, depth sensors, and maps. Spatial datasets can be incredibly large and complex, posing challenges for storage, processing, and efficient analysis.
