    - An IF game where two or more players adopt the roles of multiple PCs simultaneously is referred to as strong multiplayer IF or true multiplayer IF.

      - To date, there's been very little true multiplayer IF. Some of the problems are:
        -   **How to put IF and chat together.** Wedding an IF game to any of the available chat environments is not obvious, and most authors would not want to invent their own chat systems -- just writing IF can be challenging enough!
        -   **Multiple output text streams.** True multiplayer IF must display different text to different players. They shouldn't all see the same thing when they're playing different characters within the game.
        -   **Multiplayer puzzle design.** Many standard IF puzzles can't be used as is in multiplayer games without inviting [deadlock](https://www.ifwiki.org/Deadlock "Deadlock").
        -   **Getting people to play it.** Getting IF players together at the same time can itself be a challenge, especially when they are accustomed to playing solo.
