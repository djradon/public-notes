## Comparisons

### Webhooks vs Event Consumption

- Webhooks deliver or push events to your clientsâ€™ services, requiring them to handle the resulting back pressure. Using a scalable message broker to support consumption can alleviate this burden for your clients. How? By allowing clients to pull events based on their availability.
- Standard webhook systems generally lack event persistence for future audits and replays, a capability inherently provided by persisted message brokers.
