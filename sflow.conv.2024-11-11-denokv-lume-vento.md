## deno kv (dave)

I was thinking if we used Deno for the CLI and SSG, we could use the built-in [[Deno KV|prdct.deno.kv]] store to keep track of things like:
- fingerprinting files with hashes (for change detection)
- data file inventory (e.g., if the file disappears, prompt user whether it should be removed from namespace)
- indexing mentions of NameIndividuals for cataloging purposes.

## deno kv (chatgpt)

Using **Deno KV** for those purposes is a fantastic idea. It provides a lightweight, persistent way to manage the information you'll need to track, without introducing the overhead of setting up an external database. Let’s delve into how you could use **Deno KV** effectively for each of these use cases:

### **1. File Fingerprinting with Hashes for Change Detection**
- **Goal**: Detect changes in files by storing **hashes** in the KV store. When a file is updated or modified, its fingerprint should change.
- **How to Implement**:
  - **Initial Fingerprint Creation**: When a data file is added or indexed, calculate a **hash** (e.g., using SHA256) and store it in the **Deno KV store** alongside the file path.
  - **Change Detection**: On subsequent runs, **recalculate the hash** of each file and compare it to the stored value in the KV. If the hash has changed, flag the file as modified.
  
  - **Example** in Deno:
    ```typescript
    import { createHash } from "https://deno.land/std/hash/mod.ts";
    import { openKv } from "https://deno.land/x/kv/mod.ts";

    const kv = await openKv();

    async function fingerprintFile(filePath: string) {
      const fileData = await Deno.readFile(filePath);
      const hash = createHash("sha256").update(fileData).toString();

      const kvKey = ["fileHash", filePath];
      const existingEntry = await kv.get(kvKey);

      if (existingEntry?.value !== hash) {
        // File has changed or is new
        console.log(`File changed or new: ${filePath}`);
        await kv.set(kvKey, hash);
      } else {
        // File is unchanged
        console.log(`File unchanged: ${filePath}`);
      }
    }

    // Example usage
    await fingerprintFile("./data/sflow-ontology.ttl");
    ```
  - **Workflow**:
    - On each run, the **CLI/SSG** checks each data file, calculates its hash, and **compares it** to the stored hash.
    - If the hash is different, trigger any necessary **rebuilds** or updates.

### **2. Data File Inventory Management**
- **Goal**: Keep a **live inventory** of all data files and monitor changes, such as files being deleted or added. This inventory helps you ensure consistency between the data files and the generated namespace.
- **How to Implement**:
  - **Store Metadata**: Track files along with their metadata, such as **last modified date**, **fingerprint**, and **dataset references**.
  - **File Removal Detection**: If a file goes missing, you can use the inventory to **prompt the user** about whether the NamedIndividual or any linked data should be removed or updated.

  - **Example Inventory Management** in Deno:
    ```typescript
    async function updateInventory(filePath: string) {
      const kvKey = ["fileInventory", filePath];

      try {
        // Check if the file exists
        await Deno.stat(filePath);

        // File exists, update inventory
        const lastModified = (await Deno.stat(filePath)).mtime;
        await kv.set(kvKey, { exists: true, lastModified });

      } catch (e) {
        if (e instanceof Deno.errors.NotFound) {
          // File does not exist, prompt user for action
          const existingEntry = await kv.get(kvKey);
          if (existingEntry?.value?.exists) {
            console.log(`File ${filePath} is missing. Should it be removed from the namespace?`);
            // Here, you could prompt the user or automate removal actions
            await kv.set(kvKey, { exists: false });
          }
        }
      }
    }

    // Example usage
    await updateInventory("./data/dave-richardson.jsonld");
    ```
  - **Workflow**:
    - On each **scan**, the script checks if files still exist and keeps the **inventory up to date**.
    - If a file is removed, the **CLI** could either prompt for manual intervention or automatically remove any related dataset references.

### **3. Indexing Mentions of NamedIndividuals for Cataloging**
- **Goal**: Track all occurrences and mentions of **NamedIndividuals** across different datasets and namespaces, facilitating cataloging and easy reference.
- **How to Implement**:
  - **Extract NamedIndividual Mentions**: During the parsing of data files, extract any **IRIs** or mentions of NamedIndividuals.
  - **Store Mentions in Deno KV**: Store these mentions in the KV store, keyed by the NamedIndividual IRI. This makes it easy to **query** which datasets reference each NamedIndividual.

  - **Example Indexing Mentions** in Deno:
    ```typescript
    import { parse } from "https://deno.land/x/turtle/mod.ts"; // Hypothetical Turtle parser

    async function indexNamedIndividuals(filePath: string) {
      const fileContent = await Deno.readTextFile(filePath);
      const parsedData = parse(fileContent); // Assuming the parse function returns structured triples

      for (const triple of parsedData) {
        if (triple.subject && triple.subject.startsWith("https://namespace/")) {
          // Assuming subject is a NamedIndividual IRI
          const kvKey = ["namedIndividualMentions", triple.subject];
          const currentMentions = (await kv.get(kvKey))?.value || [];
          currentMentions.push({ file: filePath, predicate: triple.predicate, object: triple.object });
          await kv.set(kvKey, currentMentions);
        }
      }
    }

    // Example usage
    await indexNamedIndividuals("./data/sflow-ontology.ttl");
    ```
  - **Workflow**:
    - As you parse each file, extract the **IRIs** of NamedIndividuals and store **references** to where they are mentioned.
    - This allows you to **catalog the relationships** and easily generate cross-references, aiding in catalog generation and **inter-linking** data.

### **Benefits of Using Deno KV for These Tasks**

1. **Simplicity and Integration**:
   - Since **Deno KV** is built into Deno, there is no need for a separate database setup, simplifying **dependencies** and reducing complexity.
   - **Native integration** means faster performance and no cross-environment connection issues.

2. **Persistent Data Tracking**:
   - Deno KV offers **persistent storage**, meaning the **fingerprints, inventory, and indexes** are stored between runs of the CLI or SSG.
   - You won’t need to recalculate everything from scratch each time, which significantly **speeds up workflows**.

3. **Efficient Change Detection**:
   - Hashes stored in KV allow for **quick detection of changes**. Only files that have changed need to be processed during a rebuild.
   - This can drastically **reduce processing time** for large datasets.

4. **Query Capabilities**:
   - You can leverage **Deno KV queries** to efficiently retrieve information, such as **which datasets reference a given NamedIndividual** or **which files have changed since the last build**.
   - This makes cataloging and other analysis tasks more straightforward.

### **Example Workflow Integration**
- During the **CLI invocation**:
  1. **Hash all data files** and compare to the stored hashes in KV to determine changes.
  2. **Update the data inventory** in KV, prompting the user if a file is removed.
  3. **Index NamedIndividual mentions** by parsing updated files and storing them in the KV.

- During the **SSG run**:
  - The **KV store** is used to determine which files have changed and need rebuilding, ensuring that the generation process is both efficient and **incremental**.

### **Summary**
By using **Deno KV**, you can efficiently track:
- **Hashes for change detection** (fingerprinting).
- A **data inventory** for consistency and management.
- **Mentions of NamedIndividuals** for cataloging and cross-referencing purposes.

This approach keeps everything **lean and integrated**, avoiding the overhead of an external database, while providing the **tracking, indexing, and management** capabilities you need for a robust Semantic Flow setup. Let me know if you need help diving deeper into any part of this implementation!
