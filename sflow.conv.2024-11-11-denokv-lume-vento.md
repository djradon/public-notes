## deno kv (dave)

I was thinking if we used Deno for the CLI and SSG, we could use the built-in [[Deno KV|prdct.deno.kv]] store to keep track of things like:
- fingerprinting files with hashes (for change detection)
- data file inventory (e.g., if the file disappears, prompt user whether it should be removed from namespace)
- indexing mentions of NameIndividuals for cataloging purposes.

## deno kv (chatgpt)

Using **Deno KV** for those purposes is a fantastic idea. It provides a lightweight, persistent way to manage the information you'll need to track, without introducing the overhead of setting up an external database. Let’s delve into how you could use **Deno KV** effectively for each of these use cases:

### **1. File Fingerprinting with Hashes for Change Detection**
- **Goal**: Detect changes in files by storing **hashes** in the KV store. When a file is updated or modified, its fingerprint should change.
- **How to Implement**:
  - **Initial Fingerprint Creation**: When a data file is added or indexed, calculate a **hash** (e.g., using SHA256) and store it in the **Deno KV store** alongside the file path.
  - **Change Detection**: On subsequent runs, **recalculate the hash** of each file and compare it to the stored value in the KV. If the hash has changed, flag the file as modified.
  
  - **Example** in Deno:
    ```typescript
    import { createHash } from "https://deno.land/std/hash/mod.ts";
    import { openKv } from "https://deno.land/x/kv/mod.ts";

    const kv = await openKv();

    async function fingerprintFile(filePath: string) {
      const fileData = await Deno.readFile(filePath);
      const hash = createHash("sha256").update(fileData).toString();

      const kvKey = ["fileHash", filePath];
      const existingEntry = await kv.get(kvKey);

      if (existingEntry?.value !== hash) {
        // File has changed or is new
        console.log(`File changed or new: ${filePath}`);
        await kv.set(kvKey, hash);
      } else {
        // File is unchanged
        console.log(`File unchanged: ${filePath}`);
      }
    }

    // Example usage
    await fingerprintFile("./data/sflow-ontology.ttl");
    ```
  - **Workflow**:
    - On each run, the **CLI/SSG** checks each data file, calculates its hash, and **compares it** to the stored hash.
    - If the hash is different, trigger any necessary **rebuilds** or updates.

### **2. Data File Inventory Management**
- **Goal**: Keep a **live inventory** of all data files and monitor changes, such as files being deleted or added. This inventory helps you ensure consistency between the data files and the generated namespace.
- **How to Implement**:
  - **Store Metadata**: Track files along with their metadata, such as **last modified date**, **fingerprint**, and **dataset references**.
  - **File Removal Detection**: If a file goes missing, you can use the inventory to **prompt the user** about whether the NamedIndividual or any linked data should be removed or updated.

  - **Example Inventory Management** in Deno:
    ```typescript
    async function updateInventory(filePath: string) {
      const kvKey = ["fileInventory", filePath];

      try {
        // Check if the file exists
        await Deno.stat(filePath);

        // File exists, update inventory
        const lastModified = (await Deno.stat(filePath)).mtime;
        await kv.set(kvKey, { exists: true, lastModified });

      } catch (e) {
        if (e instanceof Deno.errors.NotFound) {
          // File does not exist, prompt user for action
          const existingEntry = await kv.get(kvKey);
          if (existingEntry?.value?.exists) {
            console.log(`File ${filePath} is missing. Should it be removed from the namespace?`);
            // Here, you could prompt the user or automate removal actions
            await kv.set(kvKey, { exists: false });
          }
        }
      }
    }

    // Example usage
    await updateInventory("./data/dave-richardson.jsonld");
    ```
  - **Workflow**:
    - On each **scan**, the script checks if files still exist and keeps the **inventory up to date**.
    - If a file is removed, the **CLI** could either prompt for manual intervention or automatically remove any related dataset references.

### **3. Indexing Mentions of NamedIndividuals for Cataloging**
- **Goal**: Track all occurrences and mentions of **NamedIndividuals** across different datasets and namespaces, facilitating cataloging and easy reference.
- **How to Implement**:
  - **Extract NamedIndividual Mentions**: During the parsing of data files, extract any **IRIs** or mentions of NamedIndividuals.
  - **Store Mentions in Deno KV**: Store these mentions in the KV store, keyed by the NamedIndividual IRI. This makes it easy to **query** which datasets reference each NamedIndividual.

  - **Example Indexing Mentions** in Deno:
    ```typescript
    import { parse } from "https://deno.land/x/turtle/mod.ts"; // Hypothetical Turtle parser

    async function indexNamedIndividuals(filePath: string) {
      const fileContent = await Deno.readTextFile(filePath);
      const parsedData = parse(fileContent); // Assuming the parse function returns structured triples

      for (const triple of parsedData) {
        if (triple.subject && triple.subject.startsWith("https://namespace/")) {
          // Assuming subject is a NamedIndividual IRI
          const kvKey = ["namedIndividualMentions", triple.subject];
          const currentMentions = (await kv.get(kvKey))?.value || [];
          currentMentions.push({ file: filePath, predicate: triple.predicate, object: triple.object });
          await kv.set(kvKey, currentMentions);
        }
      }
    }

    // Example usage
    await indexNamedIndividuals("./data/sflow-ontology.ttl");
    ```
  - **Workflow**:
    - As you parse each file, extract the **IRIs** of NamedIndividuals and store **references** to where they are mentioned.
    - This allows you to **catalog the relationships** and easily generate cross-references, aiding in catalog generation and **inter-linking** data.

### **Benefits of Using Deno KV for These Tasks**

1. **Simplicity and Integration**:
   - Since **Deno KV** is built into Deno, there is no need for a separate database setup, simplifying **dependencies** and reducing complexity.
   - **Native integration** means faster performance and no cross-environment connection issues.

2. **Persistent Data Tracking**:
   - Deno KV offers **persistent storage**, meaning the **fingerprints, inventory, and indexes** are stored between runs of the CLI or SSG.
   - You won’t need to recalculate everything from scratch each time, which significantly **speeds up workflows**.

3. **Efficient Change Detection**:
   - Hashes stored in KV allow for **quick detection of changes**. Only files that have changed need to be processed during a rebuild.
   - This can drastically **reduce processing time** for large datasets.

4. **Query Capabilities**:
   - You can leverage **Deno KV queries** to efficiently retrieve information, such as **which datasets reference a given NamedIndividual** or **which files have changed since the last build**.
   - This makes cataloging and other analysis tasks more straightforward.

### **Example Workflow Integration**
- During the **CLI invocation**:
  1. **Hash all data files** and compare to the stored hashes in KV to determine changes.
  2. **Update the data inventory** in KV, prompting the user if a file is removed.
  3. **Index NamedIndividual mentions** by parsing updated files and storing them in the KV.

- During the **SSG run**:
  - The **KV store** is used to determine which files have changed and need rebuilding, ensuring that the generation process is both efficient and **incremental**.

### **Summary**
By using **Deno KV**, you can efficiently track:
- **Hashes for change detection** (fingerprinting).
- A **data inventory** for consistency and management.
- **Mentions of NamedIndividuals** for cataloging and cross-referencing purposes.

This approach keeps everything **lean and integrated**, avoiding the overhead of an external database, while providing the **tracking, indexing, and management** capabilities you need for a robust Semantic Flow setup. Let me know if you need help diving deeper into any part of this implementation!

## I want to try Lume as the SSG for sflow-cli


That’s an excellent choice! **Lume** is a **Deno-native static site generator**, inspired by **Jekyll** and **Eleventy**, which makes it a great fit for your project, especially given your focus on keeping everything within the Deno ecosystem.

Here are some key considerations and steps to help you get started with **Lume** as the SSG for **sflow-cli**:

### **Why Lume?**
- **Deno-Native**: Since Lume is written specifically for **Deno**, it integrates seamlessly without requiring additional compatibility layers or dependencies from Node.js. This will make the workflow simpler and more aligned with your existing toolset.
- **Highly Configurable**: Lume is flexible and customizable, which is great for managing the **complex dataset structures** you're working with in **sflow-cli**.
- **Markdown and Templates**: Lume supports **Markdown**, **HTML**, and templating engines like **Nunjucks** and **Handlebars**, making it a solid choice for generating static sites from RDF-like data structures, and for handling the customization you need.

### **Initial Setup for Lume**
Here’s how you can start setting up **Lume** for **sflow-cli**:

1. **Install Lume**:
   - You need to install Lume globally in your Deno environment to start using it.
   ```sh
   deno install -A -f -n lume https://deno.land/x/lume/cli.ts
   ```
   - The **`-A`** flag grants all permissions, **`-f`** forces the installation, and **`-n lume`** sets the command to be invoked as `lume`.

2. **Create Your Lume Project**:
   - **Initialize a new Lume site** in your project directory:
   ```sh
   lume init
   ```
   - This command will create the basic folder structure Lume requires, including templates, configurations, and asset folders.

3. **Folder Structure for sflow-cli**:
   - The **`data` directory** remains as your **input source** for RDF datasets.
   - Lume will use a **`_site`** or **`docs`** directory to generate the static content. You can set this in Lume’s config file.

   Example structure after adding Lume:
   ```
   - data/
     - sflow-ontology.ttl
     - dave-richardson.jsonld
   - docs/   # Output directory for Lume-generated static site
   - lume.config.js  # Lume configuration
   - templates/  # Custom Lume templates for NamedIndividuals, catalogs, etc.
   - ssg/  # Your static site generator folder containing configurations and scripts
   - sflow.config  # Custom sflow-cli config file
   ```

4. **Configure Lume for RDF Integration**
   - **Templates Directory**: Store your **templates** (like for `index.html` or catalog pages) in a dedicated `templates/` folder. Lume can be configured to pick these up automatically.
   - **Create a Lume Config File**:
     - Lume uses a configuration file called `lume.config.js`. Here’s an example configuration to tailor it for **sflow-cli**:
     ```javascript
     import lume from "https://deno.land/x/lume/mod.ts";
     import basePath from "https://deno.land/x/lume/plugins/base_path.ts";

     const site = lume({
       src: "./docs",  // Source directory for Lume
       dest: "./_site" // Destination for generated files
     });

     // Example: Add base path plugin to create consistent links
     site.use(basePath());

     // Additional plugin or custom filters can be added here

     export default site;
     ```
   - **Add RDF Parsing Capabilities**:
     - Since Lume doesn’t directly parse RDF, you might need to preprocess RDF files into **JSON** or another form that Lume can use to generate HTML.
     - Use **custom scripts** in **sflow-cli** to convert RDF (like TTL) into a more usable form for templates before feeding it into Lume.

5. **Creating Templates for NamedIndividuals**:
   - **Nunjucks, Handlebars, or Liquid**: You can create your **HTML templates** using one of these templating languages, depending on your preference.
   - Example `index.html.njk` template for a **NamedIndividual**:
     ```html
     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html lang="en">
     <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8">
       <title>{{ name }}</title>
     </head>
     <body>
       <h1>{{ name }}</h1>
       <p>IRI: <a href="{{ iri }}">{{ iri }}</a></p>
       <p>Touchstone Dataset: <a href="{{ touchstone }}">{{ touchstone }}</a></p>
       <p>Catalog Dataset: <a href="{{ catalog }}">{{ catalog }}</a></p>
     </body>
     </html>
     ```
   - **Lume’s Data System**: Use Lume’s built-in **data system** to feed data into these templates. You can transform RDF into JSON and place it in a data file (`data.js`) that Lume can read to populate the template dynamically.

6. **Integrate Lume with sflow-cli**:
   - Lume can be integrated directly with **sflow-cli** for seamless site generation.
   - After making modifications to your **RDF datasets** or adding new **NamedIndividuals**, run **Lume** as part of your CLI commands to regenerate the site.
   - Example CLI workflow:
     ```sh
     sflow-cli update <dataset> && lume
     ```
   - This command first processes RDF updates via **sflow-cli** and then invokes **Lume** to regenerate the static site content.

7. **Automating the Build Workflow**:
   - Create a **script** that links your dataset changes to Lume builds.
   - Example:
     ```sh
     deno run --allow-read --allow-write sflow-cli.ts && lume build
     ```
   - This script ensures that whenever you modify RDF data through **sflow-cli**, Lume will immediately pick up those changes and generate the updated HTML.

### **Advantages of Using Lume for sflow-cli**
1. **Deno Integration**: Since Lume is a **Deno-native tool**, you don’t have to worry about compatibility issues that may arise from Node-based tools.
2. **Customization and Flexibility**: The plugin system and data handling features in Lume are ideal for generating content based on complex ontologies and RDF datasets.
3. **File Watcher**: Lume includes a **live reload feature** that watches for file changes. This is useful when actively developing the site and allows you to see changes instantly when modifying RDF, templates, or configs.
4. **Familiar Syntax**: Since it supports **Nunjucks**, **Handlebars**, and other templating engines, it’s easy to design flexible templates that adapt to the unique needs of different **NamedIndividuals**.

### **Potential Challenges**
- **RDF Integration**: Lume doesn’t have native RDF parsing capabilities, so you’ll need to use **custom preprocessing** scripts to transform RDF into a Lume-compatible format like JSON.
- **Complex File Structures**: Your setup has intricate structures, so it’s important to ensure that Lume is configured correctly to map those structures effectively into the generated HTML output.

### **Summary**
- **Install and configure Lume** to work in tandem with **sflow-cli**.
- Use **templates** to generate consistent HTML output for NamedIndividuals, catalogs, and dataset series.
- Convert **RDF to JSON** or preprocess it in another form so that Lume can use the data effectively for HTML generation.
- **Automate the workflow** by integrating **Lume** commands into **sflow-cli**, ensuring seamless site generation after any changes.

With **Lume** and **sflow-cli**, you should be able to create a robust and flexible static site generation system that meets all the needs of your Semantic Flow project. Let me know if you need any help with specific configurations or templates as you move forward!
