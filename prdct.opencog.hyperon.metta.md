## Features

- intended both for humans to script portions of AGI cognitive processes, and for the programming activity of AGI-related learning and reasoning algorithms themselves.
- combine elements of functional, logical and process-calculus-based programming
- Each MeTTa program is represented as a subgraph of an Atomspace metagraph, and carries out its business centrally by querying and rewriting portions of Atomspaces.
- handles highly abstract constructs like run-time self-modifying code simply and naturally, but is also designed for efficiency both in running its own natively implemented AGI-related algorithms, and in interfacing with external processes
