Semantic Flow /
Can you have a look at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hPQ5V0_veBgAK73KUgxj36tT_jwLj5TUQuP1nr6ivQQ/edit?gid=204838903#gid=204838903 ? I don't remember why I called that tab "10/20s schema" but maybe you can infer some features and open issues from that.

Edit
I can't access that Google Sheets link directly since it requires authentication. Google Docs and Sheets URLs typically need you to be logged in to view them (.85).

To help you analyze the "10/20s schema" tab, I'll need you to either:

Share the content - Copy and paste the relevant data from the spreadsheet
Export and upload - Download it as a CSV/Excel file and upload it here
Make it publicly viewable - Change the sharing settings to "Anyone with the link can view"
Once I can see the data, I should be able to infer what the schema represents and identify features/issues from the structure and naming patterns (.8). The "10/20s" naming suggests it might be related to decades, percentages, or some kind of ratio system, but I'd need the actual content to make meaningful inferences.

Which approach works best for you?




I thought you'd be able to see it through the Drive integration. The sheet is called "IRI schema"

Edit
I don't have access to Google Drive integration in this conversation - those tools aren't currently available to me (.9). The file system tools I have access to are for local file operations, not cloud services like Google Drive.

To analyze your "IRI schema" sheet with the "10/20s schema" tab, you'll need to:

Download the sheet as CSV or Excel format
Upload it here as a file attachment
Or copy/paste the relevant data directly into the chat
Once I can see the actual schema structure, column names, and data patterns, I should be able to infer what the "10/20s" refers to and identify potential features and issues (.8). Given that it's called "IRI schema," it might relate to Internationalized Resource Identifiers, but the "10/20s" part is unclear without seeing the content.

Which method would be easiest for you to share the data?




it says you're connected to my Google Drive, and I did the auth stuff. remember, you're the desktop client.

Edit
You're right - let me check what directories I have access to and see if I can find your Google Drive files.


L

list_allowed_directories


It seems the Google Drive integration isn't working as expected on my end. The directory access isn't available, which suggests the Drive connection may not be fully established or there's a configuration issue (.7).

Can you try one of these approaches:

Check the integration status - verify in your settings that Google Drive is properly connected
Download and upload the file - save the "IRI schema" sheet as CSV/Excel and upload it directly to this chat
Copy key portions - paste the column headers and a few sample rows from the "10/20s schema" tab
The direct file upload would probably be the most reliable way to get the data analyzed. Once I can see the schema structure, I should be able to identify what the "10/20s" pattern represents and spot any issues or features (.8).




that's the filesystem integration.

Edit
You're absolutely right - I was confusing the local filesystem tools with Google Drive integration. Let me search for your IRI schema file in your Google Drive.


S

search_files


I need to check what directories are available first:


L

list_allowed_directories


I can only access your local C:\Users\drich\hub\djradon directory, not your Google Drive (.9). The Google Drive integration you mentioned might be a different feature or not currently active in this session.

Let's see what's in your accessible directory:


L

list_directory


I only have access to your local files in that directory. For the Google Sheets analysis, you'll need to download the "IRI schema" spreadsheet and either:

Save it to C:\Users\drich\hub\djradon (or a subdirectory)
Upload it directly to this chat
Which would you prefer?




maybe you can access now after a reboot, I added H:\My Drive\internal-drive\projects\s3g to the filesystem mcp config. Maybe you need to restart.

Edit
I can check if the new directory path is accessible now:


L

list_allowed_directories


The new Google Drive path isn't showing up in my allowed directories yet (.9). It looks like I'd need to be restarted to pick up the new MCP configuration.

Since I can't restart myself, you'll need to either:

Restart the Claude desktop client to load the updated filesystem config
Download the spreadsheet to your current accessible directory (C:\Users\drich\hub\djradon)
Upload the file directly to this chat
Once you restart the client, I should be able to access H:\My Drive\internal-drive\projects\s3g and search for your IRI schema file there (.8).

Would you like to restart the client, or should we work with a downloaded copy of the spreadsheet?




https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hPQ5V0_veBgAK73KUgxj36tT_jwLj5TUQuP1nr6ivQQ/edit?usp=drive_link

Edit
Let me fetch the content of that Google Sheets document:

Failed to fetch https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hPQ5V0_veBgAK73KUgxj36tT_jwLj5TUQuP1nr6ivQQ/edit?usp=drive_link
The Google Sheets URL isn't accessible through web_fetch - it requires authentication and doesn't provide a direct data export (.9). Google Sheets URLs typically return HTML interface code rather than the actual spreadsheet data.

To access the "10/20s schema" tab content, you could:

Export to CSV - In Google Sheets, go to File > Download > CSV, then upload that file here
Copy the data - Select the relevant cells from the "10/20s schema" tab and paste them into the chat
Make it publicly accessible - Change sharing to "Anyone with the link can view" and use the publish to web feature
Which approach works best for you? Once I can see the schema structure and data, I should be able to infer what the "10/20s" pattern represents and identify features/issues (.8).




OK, I made "anyone" : https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hPQ5V0_veBgAK73KUgxj36tT_jwLj5TUQuP1nr6ivQQ/edit?gid=204838903#gid=204838903

Fetched IRI schema
google.com

Good, I can see your IRI schema now! Looking at this structure, I can infer several things about your "10/20s schema" (though I notice this appears to be a single tab view):

Inferred Features:
Hierarchical IRI Structure (.85) - Your schema follows a clear pattern:

domain/repo/namespace/entity/sub-namespace/version/filename
Example: djradon.github.io/ns/dave-richardson/default/v1/index.trig
Version Management (.9) - The schema handles:

Major versions (v1, v2)
Current version pointers (no version = current)
Complete version tracking
Multi-format Distribution (.8) - Each resource can have multiple representations:

HTML documentation (index.html)
RDF data (index.trig, index.jsonld)
Catalog metadata
DCAT Compliance (.7) - References to DCAT catalogs suggest you're following W3C Data Catalog Vocabulary standards

Open Issues I Can Spot:
Inconsistent URL Patterns (.8) - Some URLs end with / others don't (rows 21 vs 22)
Empty Rows (.9) - Rows 17-33 have incomplete data but same base IRI
Missing Versioning Logic (.7) - How does "current" resolve to specific versions?
Filename Ambiguity (.6) - When does a resource return index.html vs index.trig?
The "10/20s" name might refer to the 10s/20s row ranges where you have data vs empty rows, or possibly a naming convention I'm not seeing clearly. What specific aspect were you trying to remember about this schema?




for open issues, 1 and 2 are just sloppiness. #3... the sflow/weave/lume SSG workflow generates a current that points to the latest version. A resource returns index.html by default (as github pages does), so everything else has to be specified.

Edit
Got it - that clarifies those issues (.9). The SSG workflow handling current version resolution makes sense, and the GitHub Pages default behavior explains the filename logic.

Looking more closely at the schema, I'm still not seeing what "10/20s" specifically refers to in the tab name. The pattern I see is more about the hierarchical IRI structure you've built.

Additional observations:

Content Negotiation Gap (.7) - Since index.html is the default, how do RDF clients discover the .trig/.jsonld alternatives? Are you planning HTTP content negotiation headers, or Link relations in the HTML?

Catalog Hierarchy Complexity (.6) - You have catalogs at multiple levels (/ns/catalog/ and /ns/dave-richardson/catalog/). Is there a clear distinction between namespace-level vs entity-level catalogs?

Default Dataset Semantics (.8) - Row 37 says "default is only for entities; not recommended for datasets or catalogs" - but you have dave-richardson/default/ entries. Is this an exception or does this rule need refinement?

The comment in column K about relators bringing together "class, individual, property, annotation" suggests you're thinking about how to handle resources that serve multiple roles (.7).

What was the "10/20s" referring to that you were trying to remember? Was it about row groupings, version numbering, or something else entirely?




discovery is via the catalog doc/dcat dataset that gets returned for every "thing", e.g. https://djradon.github.io/ns/dave-richardson/catalog/ -- to make things more confusing, https://djradon.github.io/ns/dave-richardson/catalog/default/v1. "default" I think I was thinking that catalogs could also have different datasets, but now I think that's shaky.

Edit
Ah, that's getting complex (.8) - you've got catalogs that can themselves have datasets, creating a recursive catalog-of-catalogs structure. The /catalog/default/v1 pattern suggests you were treating catalogs as having their own default datasets.

But you're right to question that approach (.7). It creates confusing semantics:

Is /dave-richardson/catalog/ a catalog of datasets, or a dataset about catalogs?
Does /catalog/default/v1 mean "version 1 of the default catalog" or "the catalog's default dataset, version 1"?
Cleaner approach might be:

/dave-richardson/catalog/ = the current catalog (DCAT)
/dave-richardson/catalog/v1/ = versioned catalog snapshots
Drop the /catalog/default/ pattern entirely
The discovery mechanism makes sense though - every "thing" IRI returns its catalog/dataset metadata, letting RDF clients find the actual data distributions (.8).

Still curious about the "10/20s schema" name - was that referring to something about the URL path depth (like 10-20 character segments), or row ranges in your planning, or some other pattern? The naming seems intentional but I'm not catching the reference.




OK, slept on it. I think 10/20s refers to Oct 20-ish 2024, when I was making changes.

Anyhow, you do have to prevent an infinity mirror, which is probably what I was thinking about when I wrote "default is only for entities; not recommended for datasets or catalogs". But then I do catalog/default. 

"default" I think I'm confusing between "current" and "the user- or application-appropriate set of data returned for a given IRI.

Edit
Ah, that makes perfect sense (.9) - "10/20s" = October 20-ish 2024 when you were iterating on this schema.

You've identified a real conceptual muddle with "default" (.8). You're conflating two distinct concepts:

"Current" = latest version (temporal) "Default" = most appropriate representation for the context (contextual)

The infinity mirror problem is real - if catalogs can have catalogs, you need termination rules (.7). Your original instinct was right: entities get defaults, but catalogs and datasets should probably just have explicit versions.

Cleaner semantics might be:

/dave-richardson/ → returns current version of default dataset about Dave
/dave-richardson/catalog/ → returns current catalog (never has its own "default")
/dave-richardson/catalog/v1/ → explicit catalog version
Drop /catalog/default/ entirely
The catalog-of-catalogs recursion could work if you establish clear boundaries - like catalogs can reference other catalogs but can't contain them as nested defaults (.6).

Are you still actively working on this IRI scheme, or was this more of an archaeological dig into your October thinking?




default is not exactly "most appropriate representation", it's a fixed representation, and while it should have certain features/metadata, it's flexible. Possibly it should be a pointer to a named dataset. It aids explorability, in that every named entity has one.

I am actively working on this IRI scheme, it's a big part of what semantic-flow is, and I'm so excited to be back working on it.

Edit
Ah, that's a much clearer framing (.9) - "default" as a stable exploration entry point for every named entity, not a dynamic "best choice" selector. Having a fixed default dataset for each entity creates predictable discoverability patterns.

The pointer approach makes sense too (.8) - /dave-richardson/ could redirect to /dave-richardson/datasets/primary/ or whatever you've designated as the canonical dataset for that entity.

This aids exploration because:

Every entity IRI is guaranteed to resolve to something
Users/applications have a predictable starting point
The actual data organization can be more complex behind that stable interface
So the infinity mirror gets avoided because entity defaults point to datasets, not to other catalogs (.7).

Semantic-flow sounds like an ambitious project! Are you building this as part of a larger knowledge graph infrastructure, or is the IRI scheme itself the core product? The catalog/dataset/distribution hierarchy suggests you're thinking about serious data federation.

What's the current blocking issue you're working through with the schema?




semantic-flow is ambitious and radical. It aims to solve the problem of evolving graph data by providing a complete history. It supports free RDF data and storage with de-referencable IRIs using public platforms like GitHub.

So I think I landed on "the unversioned IRI always means current", and default isn't used to mean current... it's a dataset-pointer, meaning "which dataset gets returned if none is specified." But maybe that becomes recursive or too indirective, and datasets should be able to be defined directly?

Another issue is: does the unversioned IRI return the dataset it points to, or just a pointer to that dataset?

In terms of immutability, only the versioned IRIs are immutable, the unversioned ones are always changing (either as duplicates of the target, or as changing pointers)

Edit
That's a brilliant approach (.9) - using GitHub for free RDF hosting with complete provenance is genuinely radical. The version history becomes your data lineage for free.

You're wrestling with a classic indirection vs directness trade-off (.8):

Indirection approach:

/dave-richardson/ → returns metadata pointing to /dave-richardson/datasets/primary/v3
Clean separation, explicit about what's happening
But requires extra hop for actual data
Direct approach:

/dave-richardson/ → returns the actual dataset content from current version
Immediate data access
But obscures the indirection happening behind the scenes
The recursion issue is real if you allow datasets to point to other datasets (.7). You'd need termination rules like "default can only point to explicitly versioned datasets, never to other defaults."

For immutability semantics, I think you want:

Versioned IRIs: immutable content
Unversioned IRIs: mutable pointers/content that tracks current
The key question: when someone dereferences /dave-richardson/, do they expect to get Dave's data immediately, or are they okay getting a catalog/pointer they need to follow? Web patterns suggest immediate data is more intuitive (.6).

What does your user testing/developer feedback suggest people expect when they hit an unversioned entity IRI?




No testing or feedback yet. I agree though, we should get back data. We can just add a header that's like "this data's canoncial source is:" with the IRI that is referenced.

Edit
That's a smart solution (.9) - return the actual data immediately but include provenance in headers. Best of both worlds for usability and transparency.

Header approach benefits:

Immediate data access (good UX)
Clear canonical source tracking (good semantics)
Preserves immutability model (versioned IRIs stay stable)
Works with existing HTTP tooling
You could use something like:

X-Canonical-Source: https://djradon.github.io/ns/dave-richardson/datasets/primary/v3
X-Version: v3
This also solves your indirection concern (.8) - defaults can point to specific versioned datasets without creating recursive loops, because the header makes the resolution explicit.

The semantic-flow vision is really compelling. GitHub's infrastructure handling the heavy lifting while you focus on the RDF semantics and version management is clever (.7). Plus you get all their CDN, reliability, and access control for free.

Are you planning to build tooling around this (like automated catalog generation from repo structure), or is the focus more on establishing the IRI conventions first? The schema suggests you're thinking deeply about how the URLs map to actual file structures.




Actually, we can't control headers with github pages, so the provenance info will have to be metadata in the returned RDF.

Edit
Right, GitHub Pages is static file serving only (.9) - no custom headers. But that's actually cleaner for RDF anyway since the provenance becomes part of the data graph itself.

RDF metadata approach:

turtle
<https://djradon.github.io/ns/dave-richardson/> 
  prov:wasDerivedFrom <https://djradon.github.io/ns/dave-richardson/datasets/primary/v3> ;
  dcterms:isVersionOf <https://djradon.github.io/ns/dave-richardson/datasets/primary/> ;
  dcat:version "v3" .
This is semantically richer than headers anyway (.8) - the provenance becomes queryable, follows W3C PROV standards, and works with any RDF tooling.

Additional benefit: Your semantic-flow complete history vision gets stronger because every piece of data carries its own lineage. The version tracking becomes part of the knowledge graph itself rather than HTTP metadata.

The GitHub Pages constraint actually pushes you toward better Linked Data practices (.7). Are you planning to generate these provenance triples automatically as part of your SSG workflow, or hand-craft them for now?




Yes, generate provenance automatically as part of the SSG workflow.

Edit
Perfect (.9) - automated provenance generation will make the system much more maintainable and ensure consistency across your entire knowledge graph.

Key workflow considerations:

SSG needs to track which versioned dataset each unversioned IRI currently resolves to
Generate the provenance triples during build time
Probably want to embed this metadata in every generated RDF file for self-describing data
This creates a powerful feedback loop (.8) - your build process becomes both the version control system AND the provenance tracker. Every commit to GitHub creates new immutable versions while updating the current pointers with fresh provenance metadata.

The elegance is that your SSG workflow mirrors exactly what Git does - track changes over time while maintaining a "current" state (.7). You're essentially building RDF-native version control on top of Git's infrastructure.

Are you building the SSG tooling from scratch, or extending something like Jekyll/Hugo? The RDF generation and IRI management seems like it would need pretty specialized logic that generic static site generators wouldn't handle well.




I'd like the SSG tooling to be a plugin (or plugins) for Lume if possible.

Edit
Lume is a solid choice (.8) - Deno-based, very plugin-friendly architecture, and much more flexible than Jekyll/Hugo for custom data transformations. The TypeScript ecosystem should handle RDF processing well too.

Plugin structure might look like:

lume-rdf-processor - handles RDF parsing/generation
lume-iri-resolver - manages the IRI schema and current/versioned mappings
lume-provenance - auto-generates the version tracking metadata
Lume's data cascade would work well for your needs (.7) - you could have global IRI configuration flowing down through the site build, with each page/dataset getting the right provenance triples injected.

Deno advantages for semantic-flow:

Native TypeScript (good for RDF tooling)
Built-in HTTP client for fetching external RDF
No npm dependency hell
Fresh ecosystem that might be more receptive to novel approaches
Have you looked into existing Deno RDF libraries, or are you planning to roll your own RDF processing? The semantic web tooling in the Deno ecosystem is probably less mature than Node.js, but that might actually be an opportunity to build something cleaner (.6).




sflow has git at its core. It feels like it should support git branching in addition to native branching. But IRIs in a branch aren't directly accurate, so maybe git branching is only for development (not data management), and even then, would need guardrails/translation between the in-data named IRIs and the branch IRIs.

Edit
You're hitting a fundamental tension (.9) - Git branches are great for development workflow but break IRI semantics because the IRIs embedded in your RDF data become contextually invalid.

The problem: If you have <https://djradon.github.io/ns/dave-richardson/> in your RDF, but you're on branch feature/new-schema, that IRI doesn't actually resolve to the branch content.

Potential approaches:

Development-only branching (.8) - Git branches are just for collaboration, always merge to main before publishing. Simple but limits experimentation.
IRI rewriting during build (.6) - Detect branch context and rewrite IRIs to include branch info (/ns/dave-richardson/branch/feature-new-schema/). Complex and breaks semantic consistency.
Branch-aware resolution (.7) - Keep IRIs stable but make your SSG workflow generate branch-specific endpoints that redirect appropriately. Maintains semantics but adds infrastructure complexity.
Separate development domains (.5) - Use different domains for branches (dev.djradon.github.io vs djradon.github.io). Clean separation but requires more setup.
The cleanest might be treating Git branches as pure development tooling - you get the collaboration benefits without breaking RDF semantics (.8). Your semantic-flow native branching would handle actual data versioning while Git handles code evolution.

What's driving the desire for Git branching integration? Collaborative editing scenarios?




Next topic. IRIs represent things, some IRIs are things-that-refer, like https://djradon.github.io/ns/dave-richardson/ represents me. (ns is the repo, but also a namespace). Some IRIs represent web pages or files or "things-that-are", like https://djradon.github.io/ns/dave-richardson/index.html represents the page that gets returned when https://djradon.github.io/ns/dave-richardson/ is put in a browser, and https://djradon.github.io/ns/dave-richardson/index.trig represents the file that contains similar information (or the information that is used to generate the web page), i.e. a "distribution". 

https://djradon.github.io/ns/dave-richardson/_catalog/ refers to a catalog (slightly abstract) of datasets that a) are directly related to me, or (possibly) datasets contained in "my" namespace. 

Things referenced in datasets will get their own IRIs carved out, and so get their own corresponding datasets and catalogs.

https://djradon.github.io/ns/dave-richardson/_default is a pointer (or a copy) that points to whatever my default dataset is, which may change over time. So maybe https://djradon.github.io/ns/dave-richardson/personal-info is a dataset referenced by https://djradon.github.io/ns/dave-richardson/_default, but later I point _default to https://djradon.github.io/ns/dave-richardson/professional-info

I'm thinking to get rid of catalog/_default, unless we need multiple catalogs per IRI. 

Should catalogs (usually) hold the complete history of where the default has been pointed? You could also hold it in IRI version segments, but that might be an infinite loop, i.e., default/default

Everything is quasi-immutable because:
* pointers change over time
* sometimes you just need to delete/erase stuff

Edit
This is a really thoughtful separation of concerns (.9). You're cleanly distinguishing:

Things-that-refer (abstract entities) vs Things-that-are (concrete resources) Catalogs (metadata about datasets) vs Datasets (actual data) Pointers (_default) vs Versioned content

On catalog history tracking (.8) - Yes, catalogs should probably hold the complete _default pointer history. This gives you:

Temporal queries ("what was Dave's default dataset in March?")
Audit trails for data governance
Rollback capabilities
On catalog/_default (.7) - You're right to question this. If each entity gets one primary catalog, _default becomes redundant indirection. Just use versioned catalogs: /catalog/v1, /catalog/v2, etc.

The infinite loop concern (.6) - _default/_default would indeed be problematic. Your instinct is right - keep pointer history in the catalog metadata, not in nested pointer structures.

One clarification question: When you say "Things referenced in datasets will get their own IRIs carved out" - does this mean auto-generating entity IRIs for every subject/object mentioned in the RDF? That could create a lot of entities quickly (.7).

The quasi-immutability model is pragmatic - acknowledging that sometimes you need escape hatches while maintaining the general principle of preservability.




You could use git version history to get old catalogs if necessary, instead of holding the complete history there.

Edit
Excellent point (.9) - Git already provides the temporal layer, so duplicating that in catalog metadata is redundant. The catalog just needs to track the current _default pointer state.

This is much cleaner:

Catalog holds current _default target
Git history provides the temporal dimension
No duplicate version tracking systems
Simpler data model
For temporal queries you'd just:

bash
git show main@{2024-03-15}:dave-richardson/catalog/index.trig
Benefits (.8):

Single source of truth for history (Git)
Catalogs stay focused on current metadata
Leverages existing Git tooling for temporal queries
Reduces complexity in your RDF generation
This also aligns perfectly with your semantic-flow vision - Git becomes your complete provenance system, handling both code evolution AND data evolution in a unified way (.7).

The only trade-off is that temporal RDF queries require Git operations rather than pure SPARQL, but that's probably acceptable given the simplicity gains. Most users probably want current state anyway, with historical queries being less common.




Regarding ""Things referenced in datasets will get their own IRIs carved out" - does this mean auto-generating entity IRIs for every subject/object mentioned in the RDF? That could create a lot of entities quickly (.7)"

yes, every IRI (except for blank nodes) should be potentially dereferenceable. maybe you want to exclude some things, but think of it as a reverse index, very useful for humans and machines.

When I say pointers, last night we landed on "pointers should return all the data from the thing they point to, plus some metadata". Which is fine, but maybe to encourage specificity, we should not include the data. Then people will use the versioned IRI whenever needing to refer to specific data, and the general IRI only for general purposes. Really that whole thing is a minefield too. :(

Edit
You're building a comprehensive dereferenceable web (.9) - every IRI becomes an entry point into your knowledge graph. That's ambitious but creates incredible discoverability. The reverse index aspect is brilliant for exploration.

On the pointer data inclusion dilemma (.8) - you've identified a real tension:

Include data: Convenient for users, but encourages sloppy referencing Exclude data: Forces precision, but creates friction

The minefield is real because you're trying to balance:

Usability (people want immediate data)
Semantic clarity (specific references should be explicit)
Caching/performance (duplicate data vs extra requests)
Middle ground option (.6): What if pointers return a minimal subset of the target data - just enough for basic identification/context, plus clear links to the full versioned dataset? Like:

turtle
<https://djradon.github.io/ns/dave-richardson/> 
  rdfs:label "Dave Richardson" ;
  rdfs:seeAlso <https://djradon.github.io/ns/dave-richardson/personal-info/v3> ;
  prov:wasDerivedFrom <https://djradon.github.io/ns/dave-richardson/personal-info/v3> .
This gives enough for humans to understand what they found, but forces applications to use versioned IRIs for substantial data access (.7).

Still feels like you're designing something without clear precedent though - most Linked Data doesn't attempt this level of comprehensive dereferenceability.




middle ground seems reasonable. Critiquing your example though, it seems weird to say that I (a person) was derived from a dataset (https://djradon.github.io/ns/dave-richardson/personal-info/v3). Maybe it's impossible, but part of the motivation with this whole complexity is to clarify what is a thing-that-refers and a thing-that-is.

So only datasets get versioning? i.e., never https://djradon.github.io/ns/dave-richardson/v1 - Seems like a lot of extra complexity to keep those differentiated, but probably worth it.

Edit
You're absolutely right (.9) - saying a person "was derived from" a dataset is semantically nonsense. I conflated the entity with its representation.

Better separation:

turtle
# The person (thing-that-refers)
<https://djradon.github.io/ns/dave-richardson/> 
  rdfs:label "Dave Richardson" ;
  foaf:isPrimaryTopicOf <https://djradon.github.io/ns/dave-richardson/personal-info/v3> .

# The dataset (thing-that-is) 
<https://djradon.github.io/ns/dave-richardson/personal-info/v3>
  dcterms:subject <https://djradon.github.io/ns/dave-richardson/> ;
  prov:wasDerivedFrom <https://djradon.github.io/ns/dave-richardson/personal-info/v2> .
On entity versioning (.8) - You're right that only datasets should get versions. Entities (people, concepts, etc.) don't have versions - they have evolving descriptions. The versioning belongs to the datasets that describe them.

This does add complexity but maintains crucial semantic clarity (.7):

dave-richardson/ = the person (never versioned)
dave-richardson/personal-info/v3 = a specific dataset about that person
dave-richardson/_default = pointer to current preferred dataset
The URL structure enforces the distinction, which helps both humans and machines understand what they're dealing with. Worth the complexity for semantic precision (.8).




The tricky exception is that https://djradon.github.io/ns/dave-richardson/ is also namespace. sigh. 

So the things that would go in https://djradon.github.io/ns/dave-richardson/_catalog would be a list of referring datasets (with the default dataset called out), a list of sub-namespaced datasets (although probably not their versions)

And https://djradon.github.io/ns/dave-richardson/personal-info/_catalog 

It's a thin line saying a _default dataset is returned. I guess only things-that-refer have default datasets associated. 

So a semantic-flow site has 4 kinds of IRIs:
* IRIs that refer to non-datasets
* IRIs that refer to datasets
* IRIs that are HTML pages about the above (usually as index.html files)
* IRIs that are distributions of datasets (e.g. index.trig, index.jsonld)

Missing anything?

Edit
That's a clean taxonomy (.9), but you're missing one key type:

5. IRIs that are catalogs - like /_catalog endpoints that list/organize datasets

Your four types plus catalogs covers the semantic space well (.8).

On the namespace/entity duality (.7) - Yeah, that's genuinely tricky. dave-richardson/ serves double duty:

As an entity (Dave the person)
As a namespace (container for Dave-related datasets)
This creates some weird semantics where the same IRI has both entity properties (foaf:name) and namespace properties (contains datasets). Maybe that's just the price of elegant URLs (.6).

On _default scope (.8) - Your instinct is right that only things-that-refer get default datasets. Datasets themselves don't need defaults - they ARE the concrete data.

Catalog contents clarification:

dave-richardson/_catalog = datasets about Dave + sub-namespaced datasets
dave-richardson/personal-info/_catalog = versions and distributions of the personal-info dataset
So catalogs exist at both entity level (organizing related datasets) and dataset level (organizing versions/distributions). That makes sense for navigation (.7).

The four/five-way distinction helps clarify what operations are valid on each IRI type.




OK, true, although dcat:Catalog was made a sub-class of dcat:Dataset

I forgot one, so even treating a _catalog as a dataset there are five:

IRIs that refer to non-datasets (not versioned) 
IRIs that refer to dataset series (not versioned) 
IRIs that refer to datasets (versioned) 
IRIs that are HTML pages about the above (usually as index.html files, probably not versioned, but old versions could be looked up with git) 
IRIs that are distributions of datasets (not themselves versioned, e.g. index.trig, index.jsonld)

Edit
Perfect (.9) - that's a much cleaner taxonomy with the dataset series distinction. The five types map well to your IRI structure:

1. Non-datasets - dave-richardson/ (entities, concepts) 2. Dataset series - dave-richardson/personal-info/ (evolving collections)
3. Versioned datasets - dave-richardson/personal-info/v3 (immutable snapshots) 4. HTML pages - */index.html (human-readable views) 5. Distributions - */index.trig, */index.jsonld (machine-readable formats)

On DCAT inheritance (.8) - Right, if dcat:Catalog subclasses dcat:Dataset, then catalogs fit into your dataset series category. That's elegant - catalogs are just specialized datasets that organize other datasets.

Versioning implications (.7):

Series IRIs (personal-info/) track current version
HTML pages could be regenerated each build (Git provides history)
Distributions are tied to specific dataset versions
This gives you a consistent framework where everything either has explicit versions (datasets) or relies on Git history (HTML, distributions) (.8). The dataset series layer provides the stable reference point that can evolve over time while maintaining identity.

Clean ontological foundation for semantic-flow.




distributions always have their own version, no need for git, e.g. dave-richardson/personal-info/v3/index.trig. 

So all IRIs that end with a / "refer", and ones that end with a filename "are"

Edit
Exactly (.9) - that's a beautiful syntactic distinction that makes the semantic separation immediately clear:

Trailing slash = "refers" (abstract entities, series, concepts) Filename = "is" (concrete files, distributions, pages)

Examples:

dave-richardson/ refers to Dave the person
dave-richardson/personal-info/ refers to the dataset series
dave-richardson/personal-info/v3/ refers to a specific dataset
dave-richardson/personal-info/v3/index.trig IS the concrete RDF file
This makes versioning crystal clear (.8):

personal-info/v3/index.trig = specific distribution of specific dataset
personal-info/v2/index.trig = different version, immutable
No Git lookup needed - the version is explicit in the path
The URL structure becomes self-documenting about what type of resource you're dealing with (.9). Developers can immediately tell from the URL whether they're getting a thing-that-refers or a thing-that-is.

This also aligns perfectly with web conventions where directories (with trailing slashes) contain resources, and filenames point to actual files. Semantic clarity through familiar URL patterns - really elegant design choice.




OK, let's talk about the inputs to the SSG. Initially, it can just import a set of RDF files, which are datasets (right?), potentially in directories, but the directory structure doesn't have to correspond to the namespace, or just one file... but you could also consider a Dendron-style folder where all the source files are in the same directory with period-delimited hierarchy expressed in the filenames. Or you consider a stream of RDF data from somewhere.

The SSG needs to know the target namespace. The imported datasets might already refer to the target namespace. For IRIs that don't, you'd need to figure out which are going to minted into the namespace. 

Or maybe you have also have something like a CMS, that lets you mint new entities.

Edit
You're designing a flexible input system (.8) that needs to handle multiple data ingestion patterns:

Input formats:

Traditional file hierarchy (/dave/personal.trig, /dave/work.trig)
Flat Dendron-style (dave.personal.trig, dave.work.trig)
Single monolithic file with multiple datasets
Live RDF streams
Namespace resolution challenge (.9) - This is tricky. You need rules for:

IRIs already in target namespace → use as-is
External IRIs that should be minted → transform to target namespace
External IRIs that should stay external → leave unchanged
Potential approaches:

Configuration-driven (.7) - YAML/JSON that maps input patterns to namespace rules:
yaml
namespace: "https://djradon.github.io/ns/"
mint_patterns:
  - "http://example.org/people/*" → "dave-richardson/"
  - "http://example.org/datasets/*" → "dave-richardson/{name}/"
Convention-based (.6) - File structure implies namespace mapping
Interactive/CMS (.8) - Let users explicitly mint entities through UI
The stream input is interesting - suggests you're thinking about real-time updates to the knowledge graph, not just static builds.

What's your preferred starting point? File-based seems most MVP-friendly, but the namespace minting rules will be crucial to get right.




We could just decide that IRIs-that-refer are not namespaces, i.e., they contain only *default and _catalog and v subdirectories.

Edit
That's a clean architectural decision (.9) - it resolves the namespace/entity duality problem by making them mutually exclusive:

IRIs-that-refer (entities) contain only:

_default (pointer to current dataset)
_catalog (metadata about related datasets)
v* (versioned datasets about this entity)
IRIs-that-are-namespaces contain only:

Other entities or sub-namespaces
No _default or entity-specific content
So you'd have:

ns/ = namespace (contains entities)
ns/dave-richardson/ = entity (contains _default, _catalog, v1/, v2/)
ns/concepts/ = sub-namespace (contains other entities)
ns/concepts/friendship/ = entity (contains its own _default, _catalog, etc.)
This eliminates the semantic confusion (.8) where dave-richardson/ was both "Dave the person" and "namespace for Dave's stuff." Now it's just "Dave the person" and the namespace function moves up a level.

Trade-off: URLs get slightly longer, but semantics become much clearer (.7). You lose some URL elegance but gain conceptual precision.

Does this mean you'd restructure to something like ns/entities/dave-richardson/ vs ns/datasets/? Or keep the flat structure but enforce the content rules?




could consider ns/_entities/ and ns/_series (since remember only versioned things are datases), and then you could actually have an entity and a datasetseries named the same thing. you might not need a default dataset, since the entity could point to multiple series.

Edit
That's a sophisticated separation (.9) - distinguishing entities from their data representations completely:

Structure:

ns/_entities/dave-richardson/ = Dave the person (entity)
ns/_series/dave-richardson/ = dataset series about Dave
ns/_series/friendship-theory/ = dataset series about friendship concept
This enables powerful flexibility (.8):

Entity can reference multiple series: personal-info, work-history, social-connections
Same-named entity and series are semantically distinct but related
No need for _default pointer - entity metadata lists relevant series
Series can be shared across entities (collaboration datasets, etc.)
Entity might contain:

turtle
<ns/_entities/dave-richardson/> 
  rdfs:label "Dave Richardson" ;
  foaf:topic <ns/_series/dave-richardson/> ;
  foaf:topic <ns/_series/professional-contacts/> ;
  dc:creator <ns/_series/autobiographical-notes/> .
Benefits (.7):

Clear separation of concerns
Entities can evolve independently of their data
Multiple perspectives on same entity through different series
Enables collaborative editing (multiple people contributing series about same entity)
The underscore prefixes (_entities, _series) clearly mark them as organizational rather than user content. Really elegant design evolution.




strangely, it looks like their isn't a good general concept or term for a namespace in dcat or even rdf in general?

Edit
You're absolutely right (.9) - there's a surprising gap in RDF vocabulary for namespaces as organizational containers.

What exists:

rdfs:Namespace - but that's really about prefix declarations, not semantic containers
void:Dataset - close, but focused on statistical metadata about RDF datasets
dcat:Catalog - lists datasets but isn't really a "namespace"
skos:ConceptScheme - for controlled vocabularies, too narrow
What's missing (.8): A general concept for "IRI space that organizes related resources" - which is exactly what your ns/ represents.

The closest might be void:Dataset but that's more about describing the characteristics of data than organizing a semantic space (.7). DCAT is focused on data catalogs, not namespace organization.

You might need to mint your own (.7):

turtle
sflow:Namespace rdfs:subClassOf void:Dataset ;
  rdfs:label "Semantic namespace" ;
  rdfs:comment "An IRI space organizing related entities and dataset series" .
It's odd that such a fundamental web architecture concept lacks good RDF vocabulary (.6). Namespaces are everywhere in practice but poorly represented in standard ontologies.

Maybe this gap is part of why semantic web adoption has been challenging - the basic organizational primitives aren't well-defined.




it's arguable whether namespace IRIs refer or are. They refer to themselves. Since they don't return a file (other than index.html), they would be more like IRIs that refer.

Edit
That's a really insightful distinction (.9) - namespace IRIs have this self-referential quality that makes them conceptually tricky.

They're borderline cases:

Like IRIs-that-refer: no concrete file content, represent abstract organizational concepts
Unlike typical IRIs-that-refer: they don't point to external datasets, they ARE the container
The self-reference aspect (.8) is key - ns/ refers to the namespace concept itself, not to some external thing the namespace describes. It's more like:

turtle
<ns/> a sflow:Namespace ;
  rdfs:label "djradon namespace" ;
  dcat:dataset <ns/_series/dave-richardson/> ;
  sflow:contains <ns/_entities/dave-richardson/> .
So they're IRIs-that-refer-to-themselves (.7) - a special subcase where the referent and the organizational structure coincide.

This actually strengthens your trailing-slash convention:

ns/ = refers to the namespace concept (self-referential)
ns/_entities/dave-richardson/ = refers to Dave the person
ns/_series/dave-richardson/v3/index.trig = is the concrete file
The namespace sits at the conceptual level but organizes concrete resources. Makes sense that it would follow the "refers" pattern syntactically while being semantically self-contained.




in your example with foaf:topic, it doesn't feel right to have a series as a topic.

Edit
You're absolutely right (.9) - foaf:topic is semantically wrong there. A person doesn't have a "topic" of a dataset series - that's backwards.

Better relationships (.8):

turtle
<ns/_entities/dave-richardson/> 
  rdfs:label "Dave Richardson" ;
  foaf:isPrimaryTopicOf <ns/_series/dave-richardson/> ;
  foaf:isPrimaryTopicOf <ns/_series/professional-contacts/> ;
  dcterms:creator <ns/_series/autobiographical-notes/> .
Or even more precisely:

turtle
# The entity
<ns/_entities/dave-richardson/> 
  rdfs:label "Dave Richardson" .

# The series about the entity  
<ns/_series/dave-richardson/>
  dcterms:subject <ns/_entities/dave-richardson/> ;
  foaf:primaryTopic <ns/_entities/dave-richardson/> .
The semantic flow should be (.8):

Entity exists as abstract thing
Series are ABOUT the entity (dcterms:subject)
Entity is the PRIMARY TOPIC OF series (foaf:isPrimaryTopicOf)
This maintains proper subject/object relationships where the data serves the entity, not the other way around (.7). Thanks for catching that semantic inversion.




rdfs:namespace is a halucination?  also a namespace wouldn't be a dataset. also, dcat:dataset has a domain of dcat:Catalog

namespace IRIs could point to external datasetseries, i.e. their catalog

Edit
You're right on all counts (.9):

rdfs:Namespace doesn't exist - I hallucinated that. RDF Schema doesn't define a Namespace class.
Namespace ≠ Dataset - A namespace is an organizational space, not data content itself.
dcat:dataset domain is dcat:Catalog - So only catalogs can have datasets, not namespaces directly.
Better model (.8):

turtle
<ns/> a sflow:Namespace ;
  rdfs:label "djradon namespace" ;
  dcat:catalog <ns/_catalog/> .

<ns/_catalog/> a dcat:Catalog ;
  dcat:dataset <ns/_series/dave-richardson/> ;
  dcat:dataset <external-site.org/series/collaborations/> .
This allows external series references (.7) - your namespace catalog can point to dataset series hosted elsewhere, which is powerful for federated knowledge graphs.

The namespace becomes a logical organizational unit that can reference both local and external dataset series through its catalog. Much cleaner semantics than trying to force namespaces into existing vocabulary categories.

Thanks for the corrections - semantic precision matters here.




instead of "dcat:catalog <ns/_catalog/> ." it could be "dcat:catalog <ns/series/ns_catalog/>  but strictly speaking "A catalog whose contents are of interest in the context of this catalog." i.e., domain is catalog

Edit
You're absolutely right (.9) - dcat:catalog has domain dcat:Catalog, so a namespace can't directly use it. Only catalogs can reference other catalogs.

Proper structure (.8):

turtle
# The namespace (not a catalog)
<ns/> a sflow:Namespace ;
  rdfs:label "djradon namespace" ;
  sflow:hasCatalog <ns/_series/ns_catalog/> .

# The namespace's catalog  
<ns/_series/ns_catalog/> a dcat:Catalog ;
  dcat:dataset <ns/_series/dave-richardson/> ;
  dcat:catalog <external-site.org/catalogs/partnerships/> .
So you'd need your own property (like sflow:hasCatalog) to connect namespaces to their organizing catalogs (.7).

The DCAT model assumes catalogs are the top-level organizational unit, but you're adding a layer above that with namespaces. Makes sense that you'd need to extend the vocabulary to bridge that gap.

This also keeps the semantics clean - namespaces organize, catalogs catalog, datasets contain data. Each level has its specific role rather than trying to force-fit existing properties.




I don't mind rolling new vocabulary. Like it even. I'm conflicted about separating entities. it feels like ns/_catalog is nicer than ns/series/ns_catalog.

Edit
You're right (.8) - ns/_catalog is much cleaner and more intuitive than the nested path. The aesthetic matters for developer experience and URL readability.

The separation conflict is real (.7) - you're weighing:

Pros of separating entities:

Clean semantic distinction between entities and their data
Enables same-named entities and series
Clearer data modeling
Cons of separating entities:

More complex URL structure
Extra indirection (ns/_entities/dave/ vs ns/dave/)
Cognitive overhead for users
Rolling your own vocabulary (.9) is liberating here - you can design exactly what you need without forcing DCAT/FOAF patterns. Something like:

turtle
sflow:Namespace a rdfs:Class .
sflow:hasCatalog a rdf:Property ;
  rdfs:domain sflow:Namespace ;
  rdfs:range dcat:Catalog .
Maybe try both approaches (.6) - implement the simpler ns/dave/ pattern first (entities ARE their namespace), then evolve to ns/_entities/dave/ if you hit semantic walls in practice?

The underscore prefix pattern (_catalog, _entities, _series) does create nice visual separation of system vs user content regardless.




Can I turn off your "underscores turns text italic" functionality

Edit
I don't have control over the markdown rendering (.9) - that's handled by the interface you're using. The underscores in _catalog and _entities are being interpreted as markdown italic formatting.

You could try:

Backticks: _catalog (renders as code)
Escaping: \_catalog (might work depending on renderer)
Different notation: -catalog or @catalog instead of underscores
Or just live with the italics (.7) - in context it's still clear what you mean, even if the formatting is a bit distracting.

The semantic-flow vocabulary discussion is more important than the rendering quirks anyway. Are you leaning toward keeping entities in their own namespace section, or going with the simpler approach where ns/dave/ represents Dave directly?




you wouldn't need *entities, entities could just live at the top, and all series under *ns/_seeries

Edit
That's much cleaner (.9) - entities at the top level feel natural, and ns/_series provides clear separation for the data:

Structure:

ns/dave-richardson/ = Dave the person (entity)
ns/friendship/ = friendship concept (entity)
ns/_series/dave-richardson/ = dataset series about Dave
ns/_series/friendship-theory/ = dataset series about friendship
ns/_catalog/ = namespace catalog
Benefits (.8):

Shorter, more intuitive URLs for entities
Clear visual separation (underscore prefix for system/organizational stuff)
Entities get the "prime real estate" in the namespace
Series are clearly marked as data containers
This maps well to mental models (.7) - when someone types ns/dave-richardson/, they expect to find Dave, not navigate through an _entities layer. The data about Dave lives in the more technical _series area.

Plus you avoid the collision problem naturally - ns/dave-richardson/ (entity) vs ns/_series/dave-richardson/ (data) are clearly distinct.

Much more elegant than the nested approach. The underscore convention works really well for distinguishing organizational infrastructure from primary content.




so in terms of machine-discoverability, machines wouldn't care much about ns/dave-richardson/ because that URL would return only index.html? Or would an index.jsonld live there? Or just a catalog.jsonld that would point elsewhere.

Edit
Good question (.8) - you need to decide what machines get when they hit ns/dave-richardson/.

Options:

Entity metadata only (.7) - Basic info about Dave plus pointers:
turtle
<ns/dave-richardson/> a foaf:Person ;
  rdfs:label "Dave Richardson" ;
  sflow:hasSeries <ns/_series/dave-richardson/> ;
  sflow:hasSeries <ns/_series/professional-contacts/> .
Catalog-style listing (.6) - What series exist about this entity
Nothing machine-readable (.3) - Just HTML, forcing machines to discover via ns/_catalog/
I'd lean toward option 1 (.8) - ns/dave-richardson/index.jsonld returns lightweight entity metadata plus discovery links. This gives machines:

Basic facts about the entity
Pointers to where the substantial data lives
Follows your "minimal subset + links" approach
Content negotiation could work too:

Browser gets index.html (human-friendly)
RDF client gets index.jsonld (machine-friendly)
Or just make both available as separate files
The entity IRI becomes a hub for discovery without carrying heavy data payload (.7). Machines can efficiently find what they need without parsing HTML.




github has no content negotiation, so hitting ns/dave/ directly always returns html. You could have a convention for catalog files e.g. ns/dave/catalog.trig/jsonld/etc, but one of the big constraints here is that IRIs ending in / can only return HTML.

Edit
Exactly (.9) - GitHub Pages serves index.html for directory URLs, period. No negotiation, no alternatives.

So your options for machine discovery are:

Explicit filenames - ns/dave-richardson/catalog.jsonld, ns/dave-richardson/entity.trig
Embed in HTML - RDFa/JSON-LD script tags in index.html
Force explicit requests - Machines must know to ask for catalog.jsonld
The embedded approach (.7) might be cleanest:

html
<!-- in ns/dave-richardson/index.html -->
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@id": "ns/dave-richardson/",
  "@type": "foaf:Person", 
  "rdfs:label": "Dave Richardson",
  "sflow:hasSeries": "ns/_series/dave-richardson/"
}
</script>
This way ns/dave-richardson/ works for both humans (HTML content) and machines (structured data in the HTML) (.8).

Trade-off: RDF clients need to parse HTML to extract JSON-LD, but that's becoming more common practice. Plus it keeps your URL structure clean without forcing catalog.jsonld conventions.

The constraint actually pushes toward better web standards compliance.




ns/dave/entity.trig feels like a distribution. better to just serve a catalog file (which potentially wouldn't need v*-style versioning). Embedding in HTML I thought about, but I don't really like it.

Edit
You're right (.9) - entity.trig does feel like a distribution, which breaks your semantic model. And embedded RDFa/JSON-LD is definitely not elegant.

Catalog file approach (.8):

ns/dave-richardson/catalog.jsonld = machine-readable discovery
ns/dave-richardson/index.html = human-readable page
Clean separation, no semantic confusion
On versioning catalogs (.7) - Yeah, entity catalogs probably don't need v* versioning. They're more like live indexes that get updated as new series are added. Git history provides the temporal layer if needed.

This gives you:

turtle
# ns/dave-richardson/catalog.jsonld
{
  "@id": "ns/dave-richardson/",
  "@type": "foaf:Person",
  "sflow:hasSeries": [
    "ns/_series/dave-richardson/",
    "ns/_series/professional-contacts/"
  ]
}
Simple, explicit, follows your existing patterns. Machines know to look for catalog.jsonld at entity URLs, and it's clearly metadata/discovery rather than a data distribution.

The convention is discoverable and consistent across all entities (.8).




I feel like you would still want namespacing on the entities side... otherwise repos/sites with lots of entities would have too many top-level folders.

Edit
Absolutely (.9) - a flat namespace would become unwieldy quickly. You'd end up with hundreds of top-level directories in any substantial knowledge graph.

You'd want organizational structure:

ns/people/dave-richardson/
ns/people/alice-smith/
ns/concepts/friendship/
ns/concepts/trust/
ns/organizations/anthropic/
ns/places/san-francisco/
This gives you:

Logical groupings for navigation
Manageable directory sizes
Semantic organization by entity type
Still shorter URLs than ns/_entities/people/dave-richardson/
The _series structure could mirror this (.8):

ns/_series/people/dave-richardson/
ns/_series/concepts/friendship-theory/
Or stay flat since series names can be more descriptive and there might be fewer of them (.7).

Alternative patterns:

Domain-based: ns/personal/, ns/professional/, ns/academic/
Alphabetical: ns/a-f/, ns/g-m/ (less semantic but predictable)
The organizational taxonomy becomes part of your IRI design. What groupings feel most natural for your use case?




yeah, if you split them up (with catalog references from entities to series) you could just have a single big series for all your entities. Not that you'd probably want to, processing a big file takes a long time.

Edit
Right (.8) - technically you could have one massive ns/_series/all-entities/v47/index.trig file, but that creates practical problems:

Issues with monolithic approach:

Slow parsing/loading for any query
Cache invalidation nightmares (change one entity, invalidate everything)
Poor parallelization (can't process subsets)
Git diffs become useless (every change touches the mega-file)
Better granularity (.9):

Per-entity series: ns/_series/people/dave-richardson/
Thematic groupings: ns/_series/professional-network/, ns/_series/research-interests/
Size-based splitting when series get too large
The catalog reference approach (.7) gives you flexibility - entities can point to multiple focused series rather than one bloated series. Plus you can optimize loading by only fetching relevant series for specific queries.

Your SSG workflow could even auto-split series when they exceed size thresholds, creating v1/, v2/ etc. based on performance rather than just semantic versioning (.6).

The separation really pays off for both semantic clarity and practical performance.




It makes sense to have html returned for entities. And even though they could be templated and auto-generated, you'd want to be able to customize and over-ride them on a case-by-case basis. But for series too? Probably.

Maybe *catalog is a misnomer, since it has a meaning in dcat. maybe *_references is better? And series (and their datasets) don't need _references because they have distributions that can contain their own metadata and pointers if necessary.

Unless the entities references really are a dcat:Catalog.

Edit
Good thinking on the terminology (.8) - catalog does have specific DCAT semantics that might not fit what you're doing.

On _references vs catalog:

_references is more generic, less semantic baggage
But if what you're building IS actually a dcat:Catalog (lists datasets/series), then catalog is semantically correct
Depends on whether you're cataloging datasets or just providing discovery links
On HTML for series (.7) - Yeah, you'd probably want human-readable pages for series too:

ns/_series/dave-richardson/index.html = "About this dataset series"
Describes what's in the series, methodology, provenance
Links to current/historical versions
Definitely want override capability for custom documentation
Series not needing _references (.9) makes sense - their distributions (.trig, .jsonld) are self-describing and can contain all the metadata and links they need.

So the pattern becomes:

Entities: need _references/catalog for discovery (what series exist about this entity)
Series: self-contained through their distributions
Only organizational entities need the extra discovery layer
Cleaner model. What's your gut feeling - are the entity references actually DCAT catalogs, or something more lightweight?




I'm not sure. What would be in references that wouldn't be appropriate in a catalog. And conversely, anything you'd expect from a catalog tha references couldn't meet?

Edit
Good question (.8) - let me think through what each would contain:

What _references might have:

Links to related series (sflow:hasSeries)
Basic entity metadata (foaf:name, rdfs:label)
Relationships to other entities (foaf:knows, org:memberOf)
External links (foaf:homepage, owl:sameAs)
What dcat:Catalog expects:

dcat:dataset properties pointing to datasets/series
dcterms:title, dcterms:description
dcat:themeTaxonomy, foaf:homepage
Dataset discovery and organization metadata
The overlap is substantial (.7) - both are fundamentally about "what datasets/series relate to this entity." The DCAT model fits pretty well.

Potential differences:

Catalogs emphasize dataset discovery/access
References might include non-dataset relationships (social connections, organizational ties)
But (.6) if you keep entity relationships in the entity's own series data, then the _references file really IS just about dataset discovery - which is exactly what dcat:Catalog is for.

I'm leaning toward catalog being semantically correct (.7). You're building catalogs of datasets organized around entities. The DCAT vocabulary fits your use case well.




back on the subject of inputs... referenced entities situate themselves. datasetseries (hereby by abreviated dss) could situate themselves if they are sflow-aware, or even if they just describe themselves as datasets or dsses. otherwise:
* based on filename?
* random string? hash or abbreviated sha/abbreviated object name
* _ ?

Edit
For situating non-sflow-aware dataset series, you've got several strategies (.8):

Filename-based (.7):

personal-data.trig → ns/_series/personal-data/
Simple, predictable, human-readable
But filename might not reflect semantic content
Content-based extraction (.9):

Parse for dcterms:title, rdfs:label, or dcat:keyword
"Dave Richardson Personal Info" → dave-richardson-personal-info
More semantically accurate
Hash/deterministic (.6):

SHA of content → ns/_series/a7f3d2e/
Stable, collision-resistant
But opaque URLs, poor discoverability
Hybrid approach (.8):

Try content extraction first (look for titles/subjects)
Fall back to cleaned filename
Last resort: abbreviated hash
For entity situation (.7):

Extract subjects/topics from the datasets
foaf:Person with foaf:name "Dave Richardson" → ns/people/dave-richardson/
Use existing entity if found, mint new one if novel
The content-aware approach feels most aligned with semantic-flow's goals - let the data describe its own organization when possible (.8).




another problem with hash is, it only works for the very first import. the trouble with content based extraction, you might have a bunch of entities.

Edit
Exactly (.9) - hashes break as soon as content changes, and content extraction gets messy with multiple entities per dataset.

Multiple entities problem:

Dataset mentions Dave, Alice, and Anthropic
Which entity does it "belong" to for situating purposes?
Or does it get split into multiple series?
Potential approaches:

1. Primary subject extraction (.7):

Look for dcterms:subject or foaf:primaryTopic
If multiple, use first/most prominent
Fall back to filename if ambiguous
2. Multi-entity series (.6):

ns/_series/dave-alice-collaboration/
Based on filename or explicit title
Series can reference multiple entities
3. Interactive/prompted (.8):

SSG detects multiple entities, prompts user:
"Dataset mentions Dave, Alice, Anthropic. Situate as: [dropdown]"
User decision gets remembered for future builds
4. Default to filename always (.5):

Simple, predictable, avoids entity extraction complexity
Users can rename files to get desired series names
The interactive approach might be most practical for initial setup, with content-based hints to make the choices easier (.7).




another option is to consult a LLM like yourself. Let's remember to include an API key and chatbot endpoint in the configuration.

Edit
Excellent idea (.9) - LLM-assisted situating could handle the ambiguous cases really well:

LLM prompt structure:

Dataset contains entities: Dave Richardson (Person), Alice Smith (Person), Anthropic (Organization)
Filename: collaboration-notes.trig
Content summary: Meeting notes about AI safety research collaboration

Suggest appropriate dataset series name and primary entity for situating in namespace structure.
Configuration:

yaml
llm:
  provider: "anthropic" # or openai, local, etc
  api_key: "${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}"
  model: "claude-3-sonnet"
  endpoint: "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages"
LLM could handle (.8):

Multi-entity disambiguation
Semantic naming suggestions
Entity type classification
Namespace organization recommendations
Fallback chain (.7):

Try content extraction (clear single entity)
Consult LLM (ambiguous cases)
Prompt user (LLM unavailable)
Use filename (automation mode)
This adds intelligence to the import process while keeping it optional. Perfect for handling the edge cases that rule-based approaches struggle with (.8).

Plus it's future-proof - as LLMs get better at RDF understanding, the situating gets smarter automatically.




so is "entity" the right word for the thing that IRIs-that-ref refer to?

Edit
Good question (.7) - "entity" feels natural but might be too narrow or loaded with specific meanings.

"Entity" implications:

Often means discrete, identifiable things (people, organizations, concepts)
Has philosophical baggage about what "exists"
Might not cover abstract references well
Alternatives:

"Resource" (.6) - Generic RDF term, but overused and vague

"Referent" (.8) - What the IRI refers to, but sounds academic

"Subject" (.5) - RDF triple sense, but conflicts with dcterms:subject

"Thing" (.7) - Simple, broad, follows "thing-that-refers" pattern you already use

"Topic" (.6) - What the IRI is "about," but might imply subject matter

I'm leaning toward sticking with "entity" (.8) because:

It's established in semantic web contexts
People understand it intuitively
Your use case (people, concepts, organizations) fits the typical entity definition
The philosophical precision might actually be helpful
Though "thing" has appeal for its simplicity and alignment with your "thing-that-refers" terminology (.7). What feels right to you when you're explaining the system to someone new?




Aliasing is important. Can you check my notes an summarize how aliasing works?

Edit
I don't see any notes about aliasing in our conversation (.9). You mentioned IRIs, entities, dataset series, namespaces, catalogs, and the SSG workflow, but I don't recall you describing an aliasing system.

Could you share those notes, or would you like to walk through how you're thinking about aliasing? Given your IRI structure, I imagine aliasing could work at several levels:

Entity aliases (ns/dave/ → ns/people/dave-richardson/)
Series aliases (ns/_series/personal/ → ns/_series/dave-richardson/)
Version aliases (ns/_series/dave/current/ → ns/_series/dave/v3/)
But I'd rather see your actual design than guess at it (.8).




Sorry, check my dendron notes, especially ko., sflow., and kosmion.*

Edit
I don't have access to your Dendron notes (.9). Earlier in our conversation, I could only access the C:\Users\drich\hub\djradon directory, and when you tried to add your Google Drive path to the MCP config, it didn't show up in my allowed directories.

To review your aliasing notes, I'd need you to either:

Restart the Claude desktop client to pick up the updated filesystem config with your Google Drive path
Copy the relevant ko.*, sflow.*, and kosmion.* notes into this chat
Save the notes to the accessible directory (C:\Users\drich\hub\djradon)
I'm definitely interested to see how you've designed the aliasing system - it's a crucial piece for making the IRI scheme practical (.8). Which approach works best for you to share those notes?




C:\Users\drich\hub\djradon\dendron-workspace is my Dendron notes. Good thing to remember.

Perfect! Let me explore your Dendron workspace to find the aliasing notes:

Based on reviewing your notes, I can see several references to concepts related to aliasing, but I don't see a comprehensive description of how aliasing specifically works in your system. Here's what I can gather from your notes:

Aliasing Concepts Found:
From Dendron notes (alias-dereferencing):

You're considering aliases as alternative tokens for referencing entities
There's tension between making aliases authoritative vs maintaining backlinks
You've thought about using special characters (@ for entities, # for relations/attributes)
From Semantic Flow context:

Entities can have multiple ways to be referenced
Default datasets serve as a kind of "primary" reference point
There's the concept of pointers that redirect to current versions
Key Questions from your notes:

Should aliases return data or just pointers?
How to maintain semantic clarity while providing usability?
Whether to encourage specificity by requiring explicit versioned IRIs
What seems to be missing:
I don't see a clear, comprehensive description of:

Alias resolution mechanisms - how aliases map to canonical IRIs
Alias lifecycle management - how aliases are created, updated, deprecated
Alias scoping - whether aliases are global, namespace-specific, or context-dependent
Conflict resolution - what happens when aliases collide
Could you point me to specific files or sections that describe the aliasing mechanism in more detail? Or would you like to explain how you envision aliasing working in the context of your IRI schema and semantic-flow system?




OK, basically aliases are "sameAs". So you can "rename" parts of IRIs, but the old ones should probably still be in place, with "schema:sameAs" as the only triple in the file. 

BTW, schema:Thing is "the most general thing", makes an argument for "thing over entity"

So each namespace is divided in three: sub-namespaces, DSSs, and everything else. Then everything has an (optional, but highly recommended) index.html.

Edit
Got it (.9) - aliases as schema:sameAs relationships for IRI "renaming" with backwards compatibility. That's clean and follows established Linked Data patterns.

Aliasing mechanism:

Old IRI remains dereferenceable but only contains schema:sameAs <new-iri>
New IRI has the actual content
Enables refactoring without breaking existing references
On "thing" vs "entity" (.8) - Good point about schema:Thing being "the most general thing." That does make a stronger case for using "thing" terminology, especially if you're building on schema.org foundations.

Three-way namespace division makes sense:

ns/
├── sub-namespaces/     (organizational containers)
├── _series/           (dataset series - the DSS layer)  
└── things/            (entities/concepts/everything else)
Every resource gets index.html (.9) - perfect for the GitHub Pages constraint. Human-readable landing pages with optional machine-readable alternatives.

This creates a clean separation:

Things (entities, concepts) live at top level with optional sub-organization
Dataset Series live in _series/ with version management
Sub-namespaces provide hierarchical organization
Aliases provide stable redirection via sameAs
The aliasing approach handles both planned refactoring and organic evolution of your namespace structure. Much cleaner than trying to build complex redirect logic into the SSG.




by "actual content", do you mean the index.html? I've been assuming that other than the catalog datasets, thing IRIs don't have any RDF content themselves.

Which reminds me, every thing also has an optional _catalog.

you could also use owl:deprecated true to indicate that the old IRI shouldn't be used, maybe it triggers a client-side redirect. 

Since DSSs, sub-namespaces and catalogs are also things, it'd be nice if there was a clear term for the things that aren't them.

Edit
You're right (.9) - by "actual content" I meant the index.html since thing IRIs don't have RDF content themselves, just their catalog datasets.

So the aliasing pattern is:

Old thing IRI: index.html contains just schema:sameAs <new-iri>
New thing IRI: index.html has the actual human-readable content
Thing's catalog: _catalog/ contains the RDF metadata about related dataset series
On owl:deprecated (.8) - that's a nice touch for signaling lifecycle. Client-side redirect based on deprecated status could provide smooth UX while maintaining the semantic clarity.

Terminology gap (.7) - you need a term for "things that aren't DSSs, sub-namespaces, or catalogs." Options:

Entities (but you were moving away from that)
Subjects (RDF sense, but might be confusing)
Topics (what the thing is "about")
Items (generic, clear)
Resources (web sense, but overloaded)
Referents (what the IRI refers to)
Or keep "things" as the general term and distinguish:

System things (DSSs, sub-namespaces, catalogs)
Domain things (everything else - people, concepts, objects)
What feels most natural when you're explaining the system? The distinction matters for tooling and user mental models.




The 3-way namespace division could apply at every level. a folder is either a sub-namespace or a thing identifier; if it's a namespace it can contain 
* a _series (with a subfolder named for the series, which then containst v* versioning subfolders) 
* other things/thing identifier folders

Edit
Ah, that's much more elegant (.9) - a recursive namespace structure where the three-way division applies at every level of the hierarchy.

At any level, a folder can be:

Sub-namespace - contains other folders following the same pattern
Thing identifier - terminal folder with index.html, optional _catalog/, etc.
_series/ - contains dataset series folders (which then have v* subfolders)
This gives you fractal organization:

ns/
├── people/                    # sub-namespace
│   ├── _series/              # dataset series for this namespace
│   │   └── all-people/       # series name
│   │       ├── v1/
│   │       └── v2/
│   ├── dave-richardson/      # thing identifier
│   │   ├── index.html
│   │   └── _catalog/
│   └── philosophers/         # sub-namespace
│       ├── _series/
│       ├── aristotle/        # thing identifier
│       └── kant/            # thing identifier
└── concepts/                 # sub-namespace
    ├── _series/
    ├── friendship/           # thing identifier
    └── ethics/               # sub-namespace
Benefits (.8):

Consistent pattern at every level
Natural hierarchical organization
Dataset series can exist at any organizational level
Clear file system mapping
Scales from simple to complex namespaces
The recursive structure makes the system much more flexible for different organizational needs.




Sorry, hit enter before the 3rd thing, sub-namespace. Example looks good. Likely there would be _catalog in every folder. And even though last night I was thinking not to have v*, I think we should make catalog a dss too, then people don't have to figure out git to see the catalog history.

Edit
Perfect (.9) - making catalogs into dataset series too is much more user-friendly and consistent.

So the complete recursive pattern becomes:

Sub-namespace - contains other folders following same pattern
Thing identifier - terminal folder with index.html, _catalog/ (as DSS)
_series/ - contains dataset series folders with v* versioning
Every folder gets _catalog/ as a DSS (.8):

ns/
├── _catalog/                 # catalog DSS for root namespace
│   ├── v1/
│   └── v2/
├── people/                   # sub-namespace
│   ├── _catalog/            # catalog DSS for people namespace
│   │   ├── v1/
│   │   └── v2/
│   ├── _series/
│   │   └── all-people/      # regular DSS
│   │       ├── v1/
│   │       └── v2/
│   └── dave-richardson/     # thing identifier
│       ├── index.html
│       └── _catalog/        # catalog DSS for Dave
│           ├── v1/
│           └── v2/
Benefits:

Consistent versioning - everything gets proper version history
No Git dependency - users can browse catalog evolution through web interface
Uniform access patterns - all catalogs work the same way
Better provenance - catalog changes are tracked like any other data
Much cleaner than having special cases for catalog versioning (.9).




looking good. and for the v* folders, those can all contain index.trig/index.jsonld/etc. I guess actually RDF files only appear in the v* folders.

maybe in the _catalog datasets, you can specify which RDF formats are supported for this specific site/branch, so machines can request .trig/.jsonld based on their preferences.

Edit
Perfect (.9) - all RDF content lives only in the v* version folders, making the versioning model completely consistent.

RDF file structure:

ns/people/dave-richardson/_catalog/
├── v1/
│   ├── index.trig
│   ├── index.jsonld
│   └── index.rdf
├── v2/
│   ├── index.trig
│   └── index.jsonld    # maybe this version dropped RDF/XML
└── current/            # symlink/redirect to v2
Format declaration in catalogs (.8) is smart - enables proper content negotiation:

turtle
# In _catalog/v2/index.trig
<ns/people/dave-richardson/_catalog/v2/> 
  dcat:distribution [
    dcat:mediaType "application/trig" ;
    dcat:downloadURL <index.trig>
  ] , [
    dcat:mediaType "application/ld+json" ;  
    dcat:downloadURL <index.jsonld>
  ] .
Benefits:

Clear separation - HTML for humans, RDF for machines, all versioned
Format flexibility - different versions can support different formats
Machine discovery - clients can check catalog to see what formats are available
Graceful degradation - if preferred format unavailable, fallback options listed
This makes the system much more machine-friendly while keeping the human experience clean (.8).




Do we need to think about when a dataset version bumps? We want to preserve the ability to work on datasets in a text editor, but probably "on save" is not the right solution. On commit is one option, but bumping on commit is not mandatory because maybe you're collaborating on changes. On command almost certainly. 

I previously was thinking about using a "_next" folder/dataset next to the v* where edits could take place. You could commit with some _next laying around, but they get cleaned on a series version bump.

what's in these v* (and _next) folders anyhow. A "distribution", so a single file. Seems a shame to have all these folders with just a single file. Would there ever be a reason to have multiple files? Maybe series could contain other series, for really big datasets (dss is a subclass of dataset)

You wouldn't want all distribution files to all be "index.jsonld/trig" because imagine the editor tab pain. maybe they are named series-name_v*.jsonld/trig ? And then series-name_next?

Edit
Great questions about practical workflow (.9) - you're right that "on save" would create version explosion.

Version bumping triggers:

On command (explicit user control)
On commit (optional, configurable)
Time-based (daily snapshots, etc.)
Size-based (when _next gets too large)
The _next working folder (.8) is smart for collaborative editing:

people-series/
├── v1/
├── v2/
├── _next/                    # work-in-progress
└── current -> v2             # stable pointer
Multiple files per version (.7) makes sense for:

Large datasets - split into manageable chunks
Multi-format support - same data, different serializations
Sub-series - hierarchical dataset organization
Metadata - provenance, documentation files
Better file naming (.8):

people-series/
├── v1/
│   ├── people-series_v1.trig
│   ├── people-series_v1.jsonld
│   └── metadata.ttl
├── v2/
│   ├── people-series_v2.trig
│   └── sub-series/
│       └── active-people_v2.trig
└── _next/
    ├── people-series_next.trig
    └── temp-edits.trig
Advantages:

Clear file identity in editor tabs
Multiple formats per version
Hierarchical datasets for scale
Collaborative workflow with _next staging
The series-name prefix solves the editor tab confusion completely (.9).




in your example, you could capture the current -> v2 pointer in people-series/_catalog

multiple files per version (and a version is a dataset)... yes on large. multi-format is handled with multiple distribution files. sub-series... no, they'd be handled with a subfolder with a namespace parent. No subfolders in thing folders and no non-versioning subfolders in series folders (including _catalog) series. Provenance is in _catalog. So only one use case. Maybe another one would be "logically appropriate" or "data from multiple sources now in one dataset".

size-based bumping doesn't make sense, as bumping won't reduce the size of the file.

When you do bump, the distribution filenames get uniformized? At least by default. You can dump a distribution file from anywhere into a _next folder, and the SSG renames it when it moves it to the next v* folder.

Edit
Good corrections (.9) - you're right about the constraints and workflow.

File organization rules:

Thing folders: no subfolders (just index.html, _catalog/)
Series folders: only v*, _next, no other subfolders
Sub-series: handled via namespace hierarchy, not nesting
Current pointer: captured in _catalog metadata, not filesystem symlinks
Multiple files per version - valid use cases:

Large datasets split into chunks
Logically appropriate groupings
Multiple source integration into single dataset
Version bumping workflow (.8):

bash
# Working state
people-series/
├── v2/
│   └── people-series_v2.trig
├── _next/
│   ├── temp-import.jsonld      # messy filename
│   ├── manual-edits.trig       # another messy filename
│   └── extra-data.ttl
└── _catalog/

# After bump command
people-series/
├── v2/
├── v3/                         # SSG creates this
│   ├── people-series_v3.trig   # unified naming
│   ├── people-series_v3.jsonld
│   └── people-series_v3.ttl
├── _next/                      # cleaned out
└── _catalog/                   # updated to point to v3
Benefits:

Flexible input - dump files with any names into _next
Clean output - SSG normalizes to consistent naming scheme
Simple workflow - version bump handles all the housekeeping
The SSG becomes the "janitor" that keeps everything organized (.8).




I like the consistency of separating subnamespace folders from thing folders and series folders. Users might complain that you can't extend a namespace under a series, but I think it's okay.

Edit
Agreed (.9) - the three-way separation is cleaner than trying to handle edge cases. Clear rules are better than flexible complexity.

The constraint is:

Sub-namespace folders: contain other folders (recursive pattern)
Thing folders: terminal, contain only index.html and _catalog/
Series folders: contain only v*, _next, and _catalog/
If users want sub-organization under a concept, they can:

concepts/
├── ethics/                    # thing folder (terminal)
│   ├── index.html
│   └── _catalog/
└── ethics-types/             # separate sub-namespace for related concepts
    ├── virtue-ethics/        # thing folders
    ├── deontological-ethics/
    └── consequentialism/
Rather than trying to support:

concepts/
└── ethics/                   # would this be thing or namespace?
    ├── index.html            # thing behavior
    ├── _catalog/
    └── virtue-ethics/        # namespace behavior - confusing!
Benefits of strict separation (.8):

Predictable tooling - SSG knows what to expect in each folder type
Clear mental model - users understand the three distinct patterns
Consistent URLs - no ambiguity about what a path represents
Scalable implementation - simple recursive processing
Users adapt to constraints when the payoff in clarity is worth it (.7).




I don't want to start a new chat, because I'll lose all this context. Maybe you can generate context for a new chat for me, take your time.

Edit

Semantic Flow & IRI Schema Context Summary
Document 
I've created a comprehensive context summary that captures our entire conversation about Semantic Flow and your IRI schema design. This covers:

The core architecture and philosophy
The five IRI types and URL semantics
The recursive three-way namespace division
File organization rules and constraints
Versioning and immutability model
Aliasing system using schema:sameAs
Technical implementation details
Current development status
You can copy this into a new chat to maintain full context about where we left off. The summary preserves all the key design decisions we discussed, from the GitHub Pages constraints to the specific folder structures and naming conventions.

Is there anything important I missed or should emphasize differently in the context summary?




I'm second-guessing _catalog as a DSS again. You'd need to know what the current version is. So it could be as simple as a ".current" file in the dss directory that points to the subdirectory with the current version. Or you could just make the catalog a mutable RDF file. The file could theoretically contain its own history, using validity RDF statements. But it does add a lot of overhead. 

Probably related: It'd be great to have a _current folder next to the v-* folders (and next folder) so people wouldn't need to parse the catalog to get the current dataset.

Edit
You're absolutely right (.9) - the catalog-as-DSS creates a bootstrapping problem. You need to know the current catalog version to find out what the current version is - circular dependency.

Simpler catalog approaches:

Option 1: Mutable RDF file

dave-richardson/
├── index.html
└── catalog.trig              # single mutable file
Option 2: Simple pointer file

dave-richardson/
├── _catalog/
│   ├── v1/, v2/, v3/
│   └── .current              # contains "v3"
├── index.html
Option 3: _current folder for everything

people-series/
├── v1/, v2/, v3/
├── _next/
├── _current/                 # symlink or copy of v3 content
│   └── people-series_current.trig
└── _catalog/
    ├── v1/, v2/
    ├── _current/             # current catalog
    │   └── catalog_current.trig
    └── .current              # "v2"
I lean toward Option 1 (.8) - mutable catalog.trig with self-contained history using validity statements. The overhead is worth avoiding the complexity, and most catalogs won't change frequently enough to make the file unwieldy.

Plus _current folders everywhere (.9) for immediate access without parsing. Much better UX for both humans and machines.

This keeps the versioning benefits where they matter (actual data) while simplifying discovery metadata.




_current also allows people to distinguish their use of an IRI... do you want what is current or do you want a specific version. So there would be three copies of the current dataset, one in current, one in the v*, and one in next, and a new version could automatically be created on "publish" if next differed from current. I wouldn't want to not have a versioned IRI for the current dataset in case someone wants to refer to it permanently.

I'm not sure if you need .current if we have _current

Edit
Excellent point (.9) - the three-way distinction makes the intent crystal clear:

Three access patterns:

v3/ = "I want exactly this version" (permanent reference)
_current/ = "I want whatever is current now" (may change over time)
_next/ = "I want the work-in-progress" (collaboration/preview)
Auto-versioning workflow (.8):

bash
# Before publish
people-series/
├── v3/people-series_v3.trig     # last published version
├── _current/people-series_current.trig  # copy of v3
├── _next/people-series_next.trig        # modified content
└── catalog.trig

# After publish command (if _next differs from _current)
people-series/
├── v3/, v4/                     # v4 created from _next
├── _current/                    # updated to match v4
├── _next/                       # reset to match v4
└── catalog.trig                 # updated
You're right about .current being redundant (.7) - if _current/ exists and contains the actual data, you don't need a separate pointer file. The filesystem structure IS the pointer.

Benefits:

Clear semantics - URL tells you exactly what you're getting
Permanent links - versioned IRIs never change content
Live links - current IRIs track latest
No parsing required - direct file access for current data
This creates a much cleaner mental model for users choosing how to reference data.




And I'm not sure if we need catalog.trig

I'm just going to start leaving the underscores out because they auto-format to italics if there's two of them. But please consider "next" as _next" etc

If we have catalog DSSs everywhere catalog/current gives you the current catalog and we can still keep a catalog history.

Edit
You're absolutely right (.9) - if we have catalog DSSs everywhere, then catalog/current/ gives you the current catalog and you get full version history through catalog/v1/, catalog/v2/, etc.

So the clean structure becomes:

dave-richardson/
├── index.html
└── catalog/                  # catalog DSS
    ├── v1/, v2/, v3/
    ├── current/              # current catalog
    └── next/                 # work-in-progress catalog

people-series/
├── v1/, v2/, v3/
├── current/                  # current dataset
├── next/                     # work-in-progress dataset
└── catalog/                  # catalog DSS for this series
    ├── v1/, v2/
    ├── current/
    └── next/
Benefits:

Uniform pattern - everything follows the same DSS structure
No special files - no standalone catalog.trig or .current files
Full versioning - catalog changes are tracked like any other data
Direct access - catalog/current/ gives immediate access without parsing
Auto-publish logic (.8): When you publish, if next/ differs from current/, create new version and update current/ for both the main series AND its catalog.

Much cleaner and more consistent. The recursive DSS pattern handles everything uniformly.




I want you to keep the underscores in your responses, I'm just leaving them out of my input.

Edit
Got it (.9) - I'll keep using the underscores in my responses since they're part of the actual naming scheme.

So the clean structure becomes:

dave-richardson/
├── index.html
└── _catalog/                 # catalog DSS
    ├── v1/, v2/, v3/
    ├── _current/             # current catalog
    └── _next/                # work-in-progress catalog

people-series/
├── v1/, v2/, v3/
├── _current/                 # current dataset
├── _next/                    # work-in-progress dataset
└── _catalog/                 # catalog DSS for this series
    ├── v1/, v2/
    ├── _current/
    └── _next/
Benefits:

Uniform pattern - everything follows the same DSS structure
No special files - no standalone catalog.trig or .current files
Full versioning - catalog changes are tracked like any other data
Direct access - _catalog/_current/ gives immediate access without parsing
Auto-publish logic (.8): When you publish, if _next/ differs from _current/, create new version and update _current/ for both the main series AND its _catalog/.

Much cleaner and more consistent. The recursive DSS pattern handles everything uniformly.




Maybe we don't need catalog/next since catalogs should be machine generated. 

I'm thinking that publishing will require a commit, so you can say "everything was consistent at this time". I hope there's no situation where changes to the catalog could cause changes to the actual data because you could have an infinite loop. Seems unlikely.

Edit
You're absolutely right (.9) - catalogs being machine-generated means _catalog/_next/ is unnecessary. The SSG can generate catalog updates directly when creating new versions.

Simplified structure:

people-series/
├── v1/, v2/, v3/
├── _current/                 # current dataset
├── _next/                    # work-in-progress dataset
└── _catalog/                 # catalog DSS (machine-generated)
    ├── v1/, v2/
    └── _current/             # no _next needed
Publishing workflow (.8):

User commits changes to _next/
Publish command creates v4/ from _next/
SSG generates new _catalog/v3/ describing the new dataset
Updates _current/ for both series and catalog
Git commit captures everything in consistent state
Infinite loop concern (.7) - unlikely since catalogs are metadata ABOUT datasets, not data that affects dataset content. Catalogs describe what exists, they don't determine what should exist. The dependency flows one direction: data changes → catalog updates, never the reverse.

Publishing requiring commit makes sense for atomic consistency - everything in the repo reflects a single coherent state at that point in time.




It's possible catalog version would necessarily track dataset versions, since each new dataset gets a new catalog.

Edit
Exactly (.9) - catalog versions would naturally track dataset versions since each new dataset triggers a catalog update.

Version alignment:

people-series/
├── v1/                       # dataset v1
├── v2/                       # dataset v2  
├── v3/                       # dataset v3
├── _current/
├── _next/
└── _catalog/
    ├── v1/                   # catalog describing v1
    ├── v2/                   # catalog describing v2
    ├── v3/                   # catalog describing v3
    └── _current/
This makes sense because:

Each dataset version needs metadata describing it
Catalog v3 describes what's in dataset v3
Version numbers stay synchronized
Clear 1:1 correspondence
Potential exceptions (.7):

Catalog-only updates (fixing metadata without changing data)
Multiple catalog updates for same dataset (corrections, additions)
But starting with synchronized versioning is cleanest (.8). If edge cases emerge, you could handle them with sub-versions (v3a, v3b) or just accept that sometimes catalog versions advance without dataset changes.

The synchronized approach makes the relationship between data and metadata very clear for users.




I'm not even sure what would be in the catalog any more. For things, the catalog could be a reverse index of what datasets reference the thing. But for datasets, metadata could live in the dataset itself and probably should. Do you remember what else we were considering for inclusion in catalog?

Edit
Good question (.7) - looking back at our discussion, the catalog content was getting a bit unclear as the design evolved.

For things, we discussed:

Discovery metadata (what dataset series exist about this entity)
Links to related series (sflow:hasSeries)
Basic identification info (rdfs:label)
For dataset series, it was less clear. We mentioned:

Available format declarations (.trig, .jsonld support)
DCAT metadata about the series itself
Provenance about the series (not individual datasets)
But you're right (.8) - most dataset metadata should live IN the dataset itself:

Individual dataset descriptions
Distribution formats
Provenance for that specific version
Subject matter, themes, etc.
Maybe catalogs are mainly for discovery:

Thing catalogs: "What datasets/series are about this thing?"
Series catalogs: "What versions exist and what do they contain?" (summary level)
Namespace catalogs: "What things and series exist here?"
The catalog becomes more of an index/directory rather than detailed metadata storage (.6). Detailed metadata lives with the actual data it describes.

What's your intuition about what discovery information would be most useful?




Yeah, I think that's right. Since DSSs don't have distributions, the catalog is a natural place to put DSS-related info.

Edit
Exactly (.9) - that's the perfect distinction. Dataset series themselves need metadata but don't have distributions, so the catalog becomes the natural home for DSS-level information.

Clear separation:

Individual datasets (in v*/): Have their own distributions with metadata about that specific version
Dataset series (the collection): Need metadata about the series as a whole, which goes in _catalog/
DSS catalog content:

Series-level descriptions (dcterms:title, dcterms:description)
What the series is about (dcterms:subject)
Temporal coverage of the entire series
Update frequency/policies
Available formats across versions
Series provenance (who maintains it, since when)
Discovery keywords
Example:

turtle
# In people-series/_catalog/_current/
<ns/_series/people-series/> a dcat:DatasetSeries ;
  dcterms:title "People in our network" ;
  dcterms:subject <ns/people/> ;
  dcat:temporalCoverage "2024-01-01/2024-12-31" ;
  sflow:supportedFormats "application/trig", "application/ld+json" .
This makes catalogs much more purposeful (.8) - they're the metadata layer for the abstraction that doesn't have its own concrete representation (the series itself).




So at least we can get rid of catalog folders for every version/dataset. 

In your summary you have IRI Type 1 as not versioned. It might be nice to keep old index.html around though, especially if we allow customization. You'd have git history, but you could forego the v* folder and just do index_v1.html, etc., and the index.html is automatically "current", and you could have index_next.html for WIP. 

On the other hand, if you can customize the HTML per thing, and presumably it could have its own images and even scripts, maybe folders would be better.

Edit
Great point (.9) - if we're only putting DSS metadata in catalogs, then individual dataset versions don't need _catalog/ folders anymore.

HTML versioning dilemma (.8):

Option A: Files in thing folder

dave-richardson/
├── index.html               # current
├── index_v1.html           # old versions  
├── index_v2.html
├── index_next.html         # WIP
└── _catalog/               # DSS metadata only
Option B: Folders for rich content

dave-richardson/
├── v1/                     # HTML versions
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── photo.jpg
│   └── custom.css
├── v2/
├── _current/
│   ├── index.html          # current version
│   ├── photo.jpg
│   └── custom.css  
├── _next/                  # WIP version
└── _catalog/               # DSS metadata
Folder approach wins if (.7):

Custom CSS/JS per thing
Images, documents, assets
Rich multimedia presentations
Complex layouts
File approach wins if (.6):

Simple HTML-only customization
Cleaner filesystem
Less complexity
I lean toward folders (.7) - if you're allowing customization, people will want assets. Plus it keeps the pattern consistent with dataset versioning.




with HTML though, we need the "current index.html" to live right under the thing so that exploring the IRI for the thing returns the page. So then any current assets would need to live alongside the v* folders.

Edit
Exactly (.9) - GitHub Pages constraint forces index.html to live directly in the thing folder for proper URL resolution.

So the structure becomes:

dave-richardson/
├── index.html              # MUST be here for ns/dave-richardson/ to work
├── photo.jpg               # current assets alongside
├── custom.css
├── v1/                     # old HTML versions with assets
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── old-photo.jpg
│   └── v1-styles.css
├── v2/
│   ├── index.html
│   └── different-photo.jpg
├── _next/                  # WIP HTML version
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── new-photo.jpg
│   └── experimental.css
└── _catalog/               # DSS metadata
Publishing workflow (.8):

Edit files in _next/
On publish: move _next/index.html → index.html
Move _next/ assets to root level
Archive old version to v{n}/
Clean _next/
Trade-offs:

Root level gets "messy" with current assets
But URL ns/dave-richardson/ properly serves index.html
Versioning still works for rollback/history
Asset management becomes more complex
The GitHub Pages constraint really dictates this structure (.7).




And there'd have to be URL rewriting for asset references in index_next.html when it get copied to index.html

Edit
Exactly (.8) - asset references would need URL rewriting when promoting _next/index.html to index.html.

URL rewriting scenarios:

html
<!-- In _next/index.html -->
<img src="_next/new-photo.jpg">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="_next/experimental.css">

<!-- After promotion to index.html -->
<img src="new-photo.jpg">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="experimental.css">
SSG publish workflow:

Parse _next/index.html for asset references
Rewrite _next/ paths to root-relative paths
Move assets from _next/ to root level
Copy rewritten HTML to index.html
Archive old version with original asset paths intact
Complications (.7):

Need HTML parser in SSG
Handle various reference types (src, href, url() in CSS)
Avoid breaking external URLs
Handle relative vs absolute paths
Alternative approach (.6): Could use a convention like assets/ prefix:

html
<!-- Always reference current assets like this -->
<img src="assets/photo.jpg">
Then just move _next/assets/ → assets/ without HTML rewriting.

The asset rewriting adds significant complexity to the publishing process.




for the workflow, you'd have to archive old version first, and the move assets from _next

Edit
You're absolutely right (.9) - the order matters to avoid conflicts and data loss.

Correct publish workflow:

Archive old version first: Move current index.html and assets to v{n}/
Move assets from _next/: Copy all assets from _next/ to root level
Rewrite and promote HTML: Process _next/index.html (rewrite asset paths) and copy to index.html
Clean _next/: Remove files from staging area
Why this order matters (.8):

Prevent overwrites: Current assets moved to safety before new ones arrive
Preserve references: Old v{n}/index.html keeps its original asset paths intact
Atomic operation: If something fails mid-process, you haven't lost the current version
Example:

bash
# Step 1: Archive current state
mv index.html v3/
mv photo.jpg v3/
mv custom.css v3/

# Step 2: Move new assets  
mv _next/new-photo.jpg ./
mv _next/experimental.css ./

# Step 3: Process and promote HTML
# (rewrite _next/index.html references, copy to index.html)

# Step 4: Clean staging
rm -rf _next/*
Good catch - the wrong order could easily corrupt the current state.




I like the assets folder approach. if the html only using relative references, no rewriting necessary.

Edit
Perfect (.9) - the assets/ folder approach is much cleaner and avoids all the HTML rewriting complexity.

Simple structure:

dave-richardson/
├── index.html              # current (references assets/*)
├── assets/                 # current assets
│   ├── photo.jpg
│   └── custom.css
├── v1/                     # archived versions
│   ├── index.html
│   └── assets/
│       ├── old-photo.jpg
│       └── v1-styles.css
├── v2/
├── _next/                  # WIP version
│   ├── index.html          # references assets/*
│   └── assets/
│       ├── new-photo.jpg
│       └── experimental.css
└── _catalog/
Publishing workflow (.8):

Archive: mv index.html assets/ → v{n}/
Promote: mv _next/index.html _next/assets/ → ./
Clean: rm -rf _next/
HTML stays simple:

html
<!-- Works in both _next/index.html and index.html -->
<img src="assets/photo.jpg">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/custom.css">
No URL rewriting, no path conflicts, clean atomic operations. The convention makes everything predictable for both humans and tooling (.9).




hmmm... given relative URLs, I don't think assets folder helps because the refs wouldn't include "_next/" anyhow. But assets does keep things bundled nicely.

Edit
You're absolutely right (.9) - with relative URLs, the references would just be photo.jpg whether in _next/ or root, so the assets/ folder doesn't solve the rewriting problem.

Relative references work the same:

html
<!-- In _next/index.html -->
<img src="photo.jpg">

<!-- In index.html after promotion -->  
<img src="photo.jpg">  <!-- same reference -->
The assets/ folder's real benefit (.8) is organizational bundling:

Keeps thing folder cleaner
Clear separation of HTML vs assets
Easier to move/archive as unit
Prevents asset filename conflicts with system files
So the choice is aesthetic/organizational (.7):

Flat: photo.jpg, custom.css in root alongside index.html
Bundled: assets/photo.jpg, assets/custom.css in subfolder
Both avoid URL rewriting since relative paths work the same from both locations. The assets/ approach just provides better organization, especially for things with many assets (.6).




Or we could just require assets to come from somewhere else, which breaks encapsulation. Or no assets allowed. I'm just dreading a new copy of image files in every version. Maybe assets live somewhere else, immutable, and have to be referenced.

Edit
Good point (.8) - asset duplication across versions could get expensive quickly, especially for images.

Alternative approaches:

Option 1: Shared asset namespace

ns/assets/
├── images/
│   ├── dave-headshot-2024.jpg
│   └── company-logo-v2.svg
└── styles/
    └── standard-theme.css

dave-richardson/
├── index.html              # refs ../assets/images/dave-headshot-2024.jpg
└── _catalog/
Option 2: External hosting requirement

html
<!-- Force external references -->
<img src="https://cdn.example.com/images/dave-headshot.jpg">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto">
Option 3: No custom assets (.6)

Things get styled by site-wide CSS only
Images must be hosted externally if needed
Keeps things lightweight and uniform
Option 4: Asset versioning with references

ns/_assets/
└── dave-headshot/
    ├── v1/dave-headshot.jpg
    ├── v2/dave-headshot.jpg
    └── _current/dave-headshot.jpg

<!-- Reference immutable or current -->
<img src="../_assets/dave-headshot/v1/dave-headshot.jpg">
<img src="../_assets/dave-headshot/_current/dave-headshot.jpg">
I lean toward Option 1 or 3 (.7) - either shared assets or external-only to avoid duplication bloat.




let's go with option 1. Which allows us to just do index_v1.html etc for HTML versioning.

Can you update the context summary with our new decisions. Include whether a catalog is generated for the 5 IRI types. I guess we have a 6th IRI type, "IRIs that are assets"

Edit

Semantic Flow & IRI Schema Context Summary
Document ∙ Version 2 
I've updated the context summary with all our latest decisions:

Key updates:

6 IRI types now including assets
Catalog generation rules clearly specified for each type
Shared assets approach in _assets/ namespace to prevent duplication
HTML versioning using index_v*.html files instead of folders
Simplified workflow without HTML rewriting complexity
Asset references via relative paths to shared _assets/
Publishing workflow updated with correct ordering and Git commit requirement
The summary now reflects the cleaner separation between content that needs versioning vs content that can be shared, and clarifies which resources get catalogs (discovery/metadata layers) vs which are self-describing.




Wait, did we forget IRIs that are namespaces? They should have "namespace catalogs". Also for type #1 maybe "has thing catalog".

Edit
You're absolutely right (.9) - I missed namespaces as their own IRI type! And the naming should be more specific.

Perfect! Now we have all 7 IRI types properly accounted for:

Namespaces - organizational containers with namespace catalogs
Things - entities/concepts with thing catalogs
Dataset series - collections with series catalogs
Datasets - versioned data (self-describing)
HTML pages - human-readable content
Distributions - RDF files
Assets - shared resources
The catalog naming is now more descriptive and matches the specific purpose of each type. Namespaces definitely need their own catalogs to provide directory services for discovery (.9).




Regarding the Aliasing system, for Lifecycle: "The site generator can use owl:deprecated true" to generate a client side redirect. 

Aliasing for DSSs and namespaces cant happen via the catalog distributions. Since the dataset versions should live on, immutable, if you change a DSS name, does it start with the next version only and move forward, with a note in the catalog? Or maybe start over with a new v1.

 And if the old DSS has a catalog pointing to the current version, does that have to get updated with the new DSS path? Maybe better to leave out the next version metadata, and just provide "seeAlso" or something to refer to the new catalog.  

No need for aliasing with datasets? Since they're immutable, and redirect information would have to be provided in their DSS catalog.

Edit
Excellent points (.9) - aliasing gets complex for DSSs and namespaces because of the version immutability constraints.

For client-side redirects (.8):

html
<!-- Generated by SSG when owl:deprecated true -->
<script>
if (window.location.pathname === '/old-path/') {
  window.location.replace('/new-path/');
}
</script>
DSS aliasing strategies:

Option A: Version continuity

Old DSS stops at current version, adds seeAlso <new-dss> in catalog
New DSS starts fresh with v1
Preserves immutability, clear break
Option B: Version migration

New DSS continues numbering from old DSS
Old DSS catalog updated to point to new location
Maintains version continuity but breaks old catalog immutability
I prefer Option A (.7) - cleaner semantics:

turtle
# old-people-series/_catalog/_current/
<old-people-series/> owl:deprecated true ;
  rdfs:seeAlso <new-people-series/> ;
  dcterms:description "Superseded by new-people-series as of 2024-06-19" .

# new-people-series/_catalog/_current/ 
<new-people-series/> dcterms:replaces <old-people-series/> ;
  dcterms:description "Continuation of old-people-series data" .
Dataset aliasing (.6) - you're right, probably unnecessary since:

Datasets are immutable by design
Redirect info belongs in DSS catalog
Individual dataset URLs shouldn't change
The aliasing complexity argues for choosing names carefully upfront (.8).




So this isn't really about aliasing, it's about renaming or moving. You should be able to have aliases from any thing or DSS to any other one. Probably aliasing for namespaces shouldn't be allowed. You just have to move a namespace, copying all the old contained folders. An expensive operation that should be discouraged. I guess you could have the option of leaving redirects or sameAs's behind.

Edit
You're absolutely right (.9) - I was conflating aliasing with renaming/moving. They're different operations with different semantics.

True aliasing (.8):

Purpose: Multiple names for the same resource
Implementation: schema:sameAs relationships
Use case: "Dr. Richardson" → "Dave Richardson", "AI Safety" → "Artificial Intelligence Safety"
Catalog handling: Alias distributions contain only schema:sameAs triples
Renaming/moving (.7):

Purpose: Change canonical location/name
Implementation: owl:deprecated + rdfs:seeAlso or dcterms:replaces
Use case: Reorganizing namespace structure, better naming
Namespace operations:

# Expensive move operation
old-namespace/ → new-namespace/
├── Copy all folders and content
├── Update internal references  
├── Option: Leave sameAs redirects behind
└── Option: Complete removal of old structure
Aliasing constraints:

Things: ✅ Allow aliases (dave → dave-richardson)
DSSs: ✅ Allow aliases (people → staff-directory)
Namespaces: ❌ Discourage aliases (too many cascading reference updates)
Datasets: ❌ Immutable, no aliasing needed
This separation makes the semantics much clearer - aliases are lightweight identity relationships, moves are structural changes (.8).




For Semantic Foundation, the primary ontology will be called "sflow". Kosmion can work with semantic-flow (as can any ontology), but isn't required. Just leave Kosmion out of it. 
For publishing workflow, #8 should be, again, commit changes to git. That gives us rollback if the publishing fails.

I like the github pages points at the docs folder (as opposed to a gh_pages branch) but I could be wrong about that.

Anyhow, two different use cases... all data is contained in the repo (in a src or data folder), and SSG just runs over the contained datasets and generates everything into docs. Other use case, the repo is more like a workspace, and uses something like Weave to retrieve all the relevant data in a single source folder, and then SSG generates from there.

BUT... now I see an issue with _next. The docs folder gets generated, so likely just overwritten, and you should make the updates in the source material.

So the source folder, you should be able to work in that directly. Maybe there is no source folder. If source and destination (docs) are in the same repo, you'd have two copies of all the data. Which is not ideal. 

So maybe the preferred workflow is to keep all the source data in a separate repo, and just bring it with something like Weave at build time. 

There should be a permance checker that ensures no IRIs have been lost, or even no changes have happened to historical data. 

Maybe keeping two copies of the data is okay. Or maybe the source is only what we were using _next for. Probably this! Any issues?

Edit
Excellent analysis (.9) - you've identified the key issue with _next in a generated site workflow.

Your source/output separation solution is perfect (.9):

Source structure (what you edit):

src/
├── people/
│   └── dave-richardson/
│       ├── index_next.html        # editable
│       └── _catalog/
│           └── _next/             # editable metadata
└── _series/
    └── people-data/
        ├── _next/                 # editable datasets
        └── _catalog/
            └── _next/
Generated output (docs/ for GitHub Pages):

docs/
├── people/
│   └── dave-richardson/
│       ├── index.html             # current
│       ├── index_v1.html, index_v2.html
│       └── _catalog/
│           ├── v1/, v2/, _current/
└── _series/
    └── people-data/
        ├── v1/, v2/, _current/
        └── _catalog/
Benefits (.8):

Clean separation: Source is working space, output is publication
No duplication: Historical versions only exist in output
Safe editing: _next folders are the source of truth for WIP
Rollback capability: Git commit after successful generation
Permanence checking: Validate output hasn't lost any historical IRIs
This solves the _next overwriting problem completely while maintaining clean workflow (.9).




I was thinking more along the lines of for source:
*  "no catalogs in source",
* no HTML files at all, just HTML templates (in assets/_templates) and template mappings
* everything is implied current if no changes, implied next if changes.
* no v* folders, the data files just live at the top of the DSS path.

Edit
Ah, that's much cleaner (.9) - source becomes a pure content authoring space, output handles all the complexity.

Source structure (minimal, content-focused):

src/
├── _assets/
│   ├── _templates/
│   │   ├── person.html          # template for people
│   │   └── dataset.html         # template for datasets
│   ├── images/
│   └── styles/
├── people/
│   └── dave-richardson/
│       └── data.trig            # just the data, no versions
└── _series/
    └── people-data/
        └── data.trig            # current dataset content
Template mapping (config):

yaml
templates:
  "people/*": "person.html"
  "_series/*": "dataset.html"
SSG logic (.8):

Compare source data.trig with last published version
If changed: create new v* in output, update _current/
If unchanged: source represents current state
Generate all catalogs automatically
Apply templates to create index.html files
Benefits:

No version management in source - SSG handles all versioning
No catalog maintenance - auto-generated from actual content
Simple editing - just edit the data files directly
Template consistency - HTML generation from templates
Clean Git history - source changes show actual content changes
This makes the source truly source-focused rather than mixing authoring with publication structure (.9).




data.trigs should be dave-richardson.trig and people-data.trig;

import is a separate step to bring external data into the source in a namespace-aware, file-naming-aware manner. You can't just use whatever filename is convenient, it has to match the containing folder.

This limits the manual editing of the catalogs, but just as well. 

dave-richardson.trig could specify its own template mappings, custom HTML, etc. 

Analyse any issues.

Edit
Excellent refinement (.9) - file naming consistency prevents chaos and enables reliable automation.

Source structure with consistent naming:

src/
├── _assets/
│   ├── _templates/
│   └── images/
├── people/
│   └── dave-richardson/
│       └── dave-richardson.trig     # MUST match folder name
└── _series/
    └── people-data/
        └── people-data.trig         # MUST match folder name
Potential issues to consider:

1. File naming conflicts (.7):

What if someone wants people-data-v2.trig as the series name?
Folder: people-data-v2/ → File: people-data-v2.trig (works)
But could be confusing with versioning
2. Multi-file datasets (.6):

Large datasets might need splitting
Solution: Only one "main" file matches folder name, others are auxiliary
Or: enforce single file per dataset/thing
3. Template specification in data (.8):

turtle
# In dave-richardson.trig
<dave-richardson/> sflow:template "custom-person.html" ;
  sflow:customCSS "special-styling.css" .
4. Import validation (.8):

Import process must validate filename matches target folder
Reject imports with wrong naming
Auto-rename on import vs require manual correction
5. Case sensitivity (.6):

Dave-Richardson/ folder vs dave-richardson.trig file
Enforce consistent casing rules
6. Special characters (.5):

Folder names with spaces, unicode, etc.
File naming restrictions on different OS
The consistent naming is worth these constraints - it makes the system predictable and automatable (.8).




It feels like things are now datasets. Why was I thinking things should be separate? Mostly because things shouldn't have their own datasets... RDF-pedantically, their IRIs shouldn't refer to datasets, but even aside from that pedantic preference, while things could have default datasets for publishing purposes, better to keep the files under things dataset-free. You can have index.md that references assets, or use vento or jsx or whatever, and reference/include the catalog, but think of the things in source as mini-sites, not places for data. No need to do versioning there.

You could even think of it as two separate things. Keep the DSSs somewhere else, and just reference them from the "things" site. 

Which reminds me, I do want to be able to import ontologies and other external datasets, giving things their own "local" IRIs, with sameAs to external IRIs as necessary. 

File naming conflicts... it could be confusing, but not breaking.

Multi-file datasets, maybe we have DSS of DSSs.

case sensitivity... probably should preserve it, as much of RDF world depends on capitalization. file capitalization must match folder.

Edit
Brilliant distinction (.9) - things as "mini-sites" vs DSSs as "data repositories" keeps the semantics clean and matches web intuitions.

Separated architecture:

Things (mini-sites in source):

src/things/
├── people/
│   └── dave-richardson/
│       ├── index.md             # or .jsx, .vento
│       ├── custom.css
│       └── bio-photo.jpg
└── concepts/
    └── friendship/
        └── index.md
DSSs (data repositories):

src/_series/
├── people-data/
│   └── people-data.trig
├── ontology-imports/
│   └── ontology-imports.trig
└── friendship-theory/
    └── friendship-theory.trig
Benefits (.8):

Clear separation: Things = presentation, DSSs = data
No versioning confusion: Things don't need versions, only DSSs do
Template flexibility: Things can use any template engine
RDF semantics: Thing IRIs don't refer to datasets, just to the things themselves
External references: Things can reference catalogs/DSSs via includes
Multi-file datasets → DSS of DSSs (.7):

src/_series/
├── big-dataset/
│   ├── big-dataset.trig         # master/index dataset
│   ├── chunk-a/
│   │   └── chunk-a.trig
│   └── chunk-b/
│       └── chunk-b.trig
External import with localization (.8):

Import FOAF ontology → assign local IRIs
<http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person> gets local <ns/concepts/person/>
Add schema:sameAs <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person> for external reference
This architecture feels much more natural - things are websites, data is data (.9).




I think assets still have to live in an immutable assets folder, at least if we want to support HTML history.

big-dataset.trig could be _catalog, with other catalog folders for each chunk.

Edit
You're absolutely right (.9) - if HTML history references assets, those assets need to be immutable.

Asset immutability for HTML history:

src/_assets/
├── images/
│   ├── dave-headshot-2024.jpg      # immutable once published

Benefits:

HTML history preservation: Old HTML can still access its original assets
Asset versioning: Explicit naming like headshot-2024.jpg prevents overwrites
Hierarchical data: Master catalog orchestrates sub-datasets
Clean metadata: Each level has appropriate catalog scope
The immutable assets constraint forces good practices around explicit versioning (.8).




The underscore represents "to be ignored" in SSG-land, but "system files" in other contexts. Either way, probably just "assets" over "_assets". and the src reference can just be "/assets/..." instead of "../../..."

Edit
Perfect (.9) - much cleaner without the underscore and with absolute paths.

Simplified asset structure:

src/assets/
├── images/
│   ├── dave-headshot-2024.jpg      # immutable once published
│   ├── dave-headshot-2023.jpg      
│   └── company-logo-v2.svg
└── styles/
    └── theme-2024.css

# Thing references with clean absolute paths
src/things/people/dave-richardson/index.md
<!-- Clean absolute references -->
<img src="/assets/images/dave-headshot-2024.jpg">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/styles/theme-2024.css">
Benefits:

No underscore confusion - assets is clearly user content, not system files
Portable references - /assets/... works from any depth in the site
No path calculation - no need to count ../ levels
Standard web convention - /assets/ is typical web pattern
SSG handling (.8):

Copy src/assets/ → docs/assets/ during build
Preserve immutability - never overwrite existing assets
Validate asset references in templates
Generate asset manifests for cache busting if needed
Much more intuitive for both humans and tooling (.9).




Sorry, for catalog, we're doing catalog dir with v* matching dataset version. No catalog.trig files, right?

Edit
You're absolutely right (.9) - I got confused between source and output patterns. In the DSS of DSSs structure:

Corrected DSS hierarchy:

src/_series/
└── big-dataset/
    ├── big-dataset.trig         # master dataset content
    ├── chunk-a/
    │   └── chunk-a.trig         # chunk data
    └── chunk-b/
        └── chunk-b.trig         # chunk data
Generated output gets the catalog structure:

docs/_series/
└── big-dataset/
    ├── v1/, v2/, _current/      # master dataset versions
    ├── _catalog/                # catalog DSS for big-dataset
    │   ├── v1/, v2/, _current/  # catalog versions matching dataset versions
    ├── chunk-a/
    │   ├── v1/, v2/, _current/  # chunk-a versions
    │   └── _catalog/            # catalog DSS for chunk-a
    └── chunk-b/
        ├── v1/, v2/, _current/
        └── _catalog/            # catalog DSS for chunk-b
Source has raw content, output has the full versioned structure with catalog DSSs (.8). The SSG generates all the _catalog/v*/ directories automatically based on the source content and existing published versions.

Thanks for keeping me on track with the architecture!




Oh good point, with no _catalog folders in source, we'll need a separate metadata file for each DSS. 

I think you can update the doc again. Make sure to remove reference to next.

Edit

Semantic Flow & IRI Schema Context Summary
Document ∙ Version 10 
I've completely updated the context summary to reflect the new source/output architecture:

Key changes:

Removed all _next references - source now represents current state
Added source vs output distinction - clear separation between authoring and publication
Things as mini-sites - presentation layer with templates, not datasets
File naming consistency - dataset files must match folder names
Metadata files - separate .meta.yml files for DSS descriptions since no _catalog in source
Asset immutability - explicit versioning in filenames, absolute paths
Import process - namespace-aware external data integration
Clean workflow - source editing → SSG generation → publication
The architecture now cleanly separates content authoring (source) from publication structure (output), making it much more intuitive for users while maintaining all the semantic and versioning benefits (.9).




For your "Generated output gets the catalog structure:" example, the "master dataset content" file doesn't get represented in the historical. Same for chunk-a/b.trig

The metadata files should be big-dataset.trig, no yml

Edit
You're absolutely right (.9) - I was inconsistent about the historical representation and metadata format.

Corrected DSS hierarchy in output:

docs/_series/
└── big-dataset/
    ├── v1/
    │   └── big-dataset_v1.trig     # master dataset content in version
    ├── v2/
    │   └── big-dataset_v2.trig     # master dataset content in version  
    ├── _current/
    │   └── big-dataset_current.trig # current master dataset content
    ├── _catalog/                    # catalog DSS for big-dataset
    │   ├── v1/, v2/, _current/      # catalog versions matching dataset versions
    ├── chunk-a/
    │   ├── v1/
    │   │   └── chunk-a_v1.trig     # chunk content in version
    │   ├── v2/, _current/
    │   └── _catalog/                # catalog DSS for chunk-a
    └── chunk-b/
        ├── v1/
        │   └── chunk-b_v1.trig     # chunk content in version
        ├── v2/, _current/
        └── _catalog/                # catalog DSS for chunk-b
And corrected source metadata:

src/_series/
└── big-dataset/
    ├── big-dataset.trig             # master dataset content + metadata
    ├── chunk-a/
    │   └── chunk-a.trig             # chunk data + metadata
    └── chunk-b/
        └── chunk-b.trig             # chunk data + metadata
The .trig files contain both the actual data AND the metadata about the dataset (.8). No separate .meta.yml files needed - it's all RDF.




For the DSS hierarchy output, we could just put "current" at the root, but then root might get cluttered or get namespace collisions. So leave as it for now. 

sflow ontology should have a way to specify whether a distribution is immutable or not, if there isn't already a predicate for that elsewhere.

For DSSs of DSSs, the parent version should probably usually bump when a contained DSS version bumps. Or really, it must bump.

Maybe we should include "catalog" in the name for the DSS metadata files. Helps differentiate between the data files.

Edit
Good points (.9) - these refinements address important edge cases.

Updated source with catalog naming:

src/_series/
└── big-dataset/
    ├── big-dataset.trig                    # master dataset content
    ├── big-dataset.catalog.trig            # metadata about big-dataset DSS
    ├── chunk-a/
    │   ├── chunk-a.trig                    # chunk data
    │   └── chunk-a.catalog.trig            # metadata about chunk-a DSS
    └── chunk-b/
        ├── chunk-b.trig                    # chunk data
        └── chunk-b.catalog.trig            # metadata about chunk-b DSS
Cascading version bumps (.8) - absolutely necessary:

# If chunk-a changes from v2 to v3:
chunk-a/v3/chunk-a_v3.trig         # new chunk version
big-dataset/v5/big-dataset_v5.trig  # parent MUST bump (was v4)
sflow ontology immutability property (.7):

turtle
# In sflow ontology
sflow:immutable a rdf:Property ;
  rdfs:domain dcat:Distribution ;
  rdfs:range xsd:boolean ;
  rdfs:comment "Whether this distribution's content will never change" .

# Usage
<v3/people-data_v3.trig> sflow:immutable true .
<_current/people-data_current.trig> sflow:immutable false .
Benefits:

Clear file roles: .catalog.trig vs data .trig
Dependency tracking: Parent versions reflect child changes
Immutability semantics: Explicit declaration of change policy
Root namespace: Stays clean, avoids collisions with _current/ approach
The cascading version bumps ensure referential integrity across the DSS hierarchy (.8).




No master dataset content... "big-dataset" is the name of a DSS. DSSs don't have content, only catalogs and contained/versioned datasets. It's actually very confusing because the DSS IRI represents both the series and the versioned datasets it contains. How can we fix that?

The domain of sflow:immutable should include dcat:DataSet, and it's used to differentiate the v* files/datasets from the _current ones.

Edit
You're absolutely right (.9) - the DSS IRI ambiguity is a real semantic problem. The same IRI represents both the abstract series AND the individual datasets within it.

The ambiguity:

ns/_series/people-data/ = the dataset series (abstract)
ns/_series/people-data/v3/ = dataset version 3 (concrete)
But what does ns/_series/people-data/ dereference to?
Potential solutions:

Option A: Separate IRIs

ns/_series/people-data/         # series IRI (abstract)
ns/_series/people-data/data/v3/ # dataset IRI (concrete)
Option B: Fragment identifiers

ns/_series/people-data/#series  # series IRI
ns/_series/people-data/v3/      # dataset IRI
Option C: Type-based resolution

# Same IRI, different representations based on Accept headers
# HTML request → series description page
# RDF request → current dataset content
For sflow:immutable (.8):

turtle
sflow:immutable a rdf:Property ;
  rdfs:domain dcat:Dataset ;  # includes both versioned and current
  rdfs:range xsd:boolean .

# Usage
<v3/> sflow:immutable true .    # versioned datasets are immutable
<_current/> sflow:immutable false . # current datasets are mutable
Corrected source structure (no master content):

src/_series/
└── big-dataset/
    └── big-dataset.catalog.trig    # ONLY catalog metadata, no dataset content
Which disambiguation approach feels most natural to you? (.7)




we could probably use better terms, these aren't just any DSSs, they're sets of versioned datasets, call them v-series for now

I hate fragment identifiers. we can't do content handling with github. But also, remember that IRIs ending in / don't "dereference" to anything concrete (if by dereference you mean what gets returned by an http request), they only name things. So I'm leaning to option A, except 

We could consider splitting them apart in the hierarchy:

ns/_v-series/people-data/          # series IRI 
ns/_datasets/people-data/    # dataset IRI 

I mean, there's no reason that the datasets have to live under their series? It'd be nice, though, so could also consider

ns/_data/people-data/_v-series # refers to the versioned DSS
ns/_data/people-data/    #persistent dataset URL refers to the dataset "in general"

Edit
Excellent clarification (.9) - "v-series" is much clearer than the overloaded "DSS", and you're right that trailing slash IRIs don't dereference to concrete content.

Your _data/ approach is intriguing:

ns/_data/people-data/                    # dataset IRI (general/current)
ns/_data/people-data/_v-series/          # v-series IRI (versioning metadata)
ns/_data/people-data/v1/                 # specific version
ns/_data/people-data/v2/
ns/_data/people-data/_current/
Benefits (.8):

Clear semantics: Dataset vs versioning-system are distinct concepts
Logical grouping: All people-data stuff lives under one roof
URL clarity: _v-series makes the versioning aspect explicit
No hierarchy confusion: Dataset and v-series have separate identities
Alternative naming (.7):

ns/_data/people-data/                    # dataset resource
ns/_data/people-data/_versions/          # version management metadata
Source structure would become:

src/_data/
└── people-data/
    ├── people-data.trig                 # current dataset content
    └── people-data.versions.trig        # v-series metadata
This feels much more semantically clean (.8) - the dataset concept is primary, versioning is a management layer on top of it. What do you think about _versions vs _v-series?




I like the alternative naming. Source structure is not quite right. versioning is managed by the SSG. v-series metadata could live at people-data/_versions/_catalog

What do you think?

Edit
Perfect (.9) - that's much cleaner. The SSG handles all the versioning mechanics, and the v-series metadata lives where catalogs belong.

Corrected source structure:

src/_data/
└── people-data/
    ├── people-data.trig                 # current dataset content
    └── _versions/
        └── _catalog.trig                # v-series metadata (descriptions, policies, etc.)
Generated output:

docs/_data/
└── people-data/
    ├── v1/, v2/, _current/              # dataset versions (SSG managed)
    ├── _versions/                       # v-series IRI
    │   └── _catalog/                    # v-series catalog DSS
    │       ├── v1/, v2/, _current/      # catalog versions
    └── _catalog/                        # dataset catalog DSS  
        ├── v1/, v2/, _current/          # dataset-level catalog versions
Benefits (.8):

Source simplicity: Just current content + v-series metadata
Clear semantics: Dataset at /people-data/, v-series at /people-data/_versions/
SSG responsibility: All version folders generated automatically
Metadata separation: Dataset catalogs vs v-series catalogs distinct
This keeps the source focused on content while letting the SSG handle all the versioning complexity. The _versions/_catalog.trig clearly indicates "metadata about the versioning system for this dataset" (.9).




it still a little confusing. I'm not sure about _versions/ in src. Ideally catalogs are generated, and maybe the v-series catalog can be generated from the dataset's metadata plus the sflow conventions.

In the output, maybe _versions/ functions more like a named thing with no content. And the DSS AND dataset metadata can just live in the people-data/catalog

Edit
You're absolutely right (.9) - much cleaner to auto-generate everything and avoid the source complexity.

Simplified source:

src/_data/
└── people-data/
    └── people-data.trig                 # just the dataset content
Generated output:

docs/_data/
└── people-data/                         # dataset IRI  
    ├── v1/, v2/, _current/              # dataset versions
    ├── _versions/                       # v-series IRI (thing with no content)
    │   └── index.html                   # describes the versioning system
    └── _catalog/                        # unified catalog DSS
        ├── v1/, v2/, _current/          # contains BOTH dataset AND v-series metadata
Benefits (.8):

Source minimal: Just the actual data content
Auto-generated catalogs: SSG extracts metadata from dataset + applies sflow conventions
_versions/ as named thing: Has identity but no versioned content itself
Unified catalog: Simpler - one catalog covers both dataset and v-series concerns
Less confusion: No weird _versions/_catalog nesting
The catalog contains (.7):

Dataset-level metadata (what's in v1, v2, etc.)
V-series metadata (update policies, temporal coverage, etc.)
All auto-generated from dataset content + sflow defaults
This feels much more natural - the versioning system gets a name/IRI but the metadata all lives in one logical place (.9).




I guess each dataset version also has a catalog? Or maybe it all lives together just under the dataset IRI

and we've been omitting index.html, but every output folder everywhere should have an index.html. 

So more updates for ya. Under IRI Types... #3, IRIs that refer to v-series, I guess not explicitly versioned, but cataloged along with the dataset-in-general under the dataset IRI. A dataset always has exactly 1 v-series. We can address datasets of datasets too.

Also for #3, the v-series doesn't contain datasets so much as reference them. Catalog lives with the dataset general catalog. For #4 any catalog data can probably live in the general dataset catalog?

#6, IRIs that are distributions always live under a version dataset.

Edit
Perfect clarifications (.9) - let me update the IRI types to reflect the cleaner architecture.

Perfect! Updated the context to reflect:

Key changes:

V-series replaces DSS terminology - clearer about versioning role
Unified catalogs - dataset and v-series metadata live together under dataset IRI
Universal index.html - every folder gets human-readable content
V-series as references - they point to dataset versions rather than "containing" them
Distributions under versions - RDF files always live in versioned datasets
1:1 relationship - every dataset has exactly one v-series
The architecture is now much cleaner with v-series being the versioning management layer that references (rather than contains) the actual dataset versions (.9).




I was previously thinking (at least 8 months ago, up until recently) that (at least some) data that corresponds to an entity should be co-located with its identifier. What are the benefits of separating data from identifiers, and linking them via an entity catalog.

Edit
Great question (.8) - there are compelling arguments on both sides. Let me analyze the trade-offs:

Benefits of separation (current approach):

1. Semantic clarity (.9):

Entity IRI refers to the thing itself, not data about it
Follows web architecture - URIs identify resources, not their descriptions
Clear distinction between "Dave Richardson" vs "data about Dave Richardson"
2. Data management flexibility (.8):

Multiple datasets can describe the same entity
Entity can exist without any local data (just external references)
Datasets can describe multiple entities
Easier to manage large datasets separately from entity identity
3. Versioning simplicity (.7):

Entity identity remains stable while data evolves
No confusion about whether entity IRI points to v1, v2, or current data
Entity catalog tracks which datasets reference it
Benefits of co-location:

1. Convenience (.8):

One-stop shop - entity IRI gives you everything about that entity
No extra lookup to find relevant data
Simpler mental model for users
2. Performance (.6):

Fewer HTTP requests to get entity + data
Better for mobile/slow connections
3. Atomic updates (.7):

Entity and its data can be updated together
Less complex dependency management
The key question (.8): What should ns/dave-richardson/ return when dereferenced? Just identity/catalog info, or actual data about Dave?

Your separation approach feels more architecturally sound for a system aiming to be a comprehensive semantic web infrastructure (.7). Thoughts?




co-location doesn't give you everything, it just give you something. The default data doesn't require a lookup perhaps, if you assume certain conventions. But all that other data does, and that stuff is more likely to be legit and not just assembled for the purposes of displaying a  webpage. For "atomic updates", what does it mean to update an entity? We're really talking about entity identifiers, and those are permanent.

ns/dave-richardson/ always returns an HTML. You could embed the dataset in that, but assuming you'd rather not have to extricate data from HTML...

might be my worst chat of the day. time for bed.

Edit
You're absolutely right (.9) - I was conflating concepts badly.

Key insights from your response:

Co-location illusion (.8):

Default data isn't "everything" - just whatever someone decided to bundle
Real/authoritative data likely lives in purpose-built datasets anyway
Co-location gives false sense of completeness
Entity identity vs entity data (.9):

Entities (identifiers) are permanent - they don't "update"
Only data ABOUT entities updates
Conflating the two creates semantic confusion
Dereference reality (.7):

ns/dave-richardson/ returns HTML for humans
Embedding RDF in HTML is messy and requires extraction
Separation keeps concerns clean
Your separation approach is architecturally sound - entities are stable identifiers that point to evolving data via catalogs, rather than trying to be data containers themselves.

Sleep well! This has been a really productive design session. The semantic-flow architecture is getting quite elegant (.8).




Can datasets really be unversioned? Maybe not? 

In Overview, let's 
* define the meaning of dereferenceable
* describe the two "hearts" of semantic flow: identifiers and versioned datasets
* include a description of a v-series. "V-series: every dataset has an associated DatasetSeries (as defined in dcat v3) that tracks each version of the data. On publish, and dataset that contains changed data gets a new version"

Edit

Semantic Flow & IRI Schema Context Summary
Document ∙ Version 16 
You're right about datasets being versioned (.9) - even "current" datasets are really just pointers to the latest version. The "Two Hearts" framing captures the essential architecture much better than just focusing on dereferenceability.

The v-series definition using DCAT v3 DatasetSeries grounds it in established standards, and the "on publish" trigger makes the versioning lifecycle clear. This overview now properly emphasizes that semantic-flow is fundamentally about the marriage of stable identity and immutable data versioning (.8).




Maybe instead of "on publish", we want something else, like "on checkpoint" or "on weave", because you're not actually publishing until the SSG is triggered. Maybe you don't want to publish immediately, there's still dev work to be done or data tests to be run.

Edit
Excellent point (.9) - "publish" implies the final step of making data publicly available, but version creation happens earlier in the workflow.

Better alternatives:

"On checkpoint" (.8) - suggests a deliberate save point during development "On weave" (.7) - ties to your weave tooling concept "On commit" (.6) - clear but might be confused with Git commits "On version" (.5) - bit redundant "On snapshot" (.7) - captures the immutable preservation aspect


Semantic Flow & IRI Schema Context Summary
Document ∙ Version 17 
"Checkpoint" feels right (.8) - it suggests a deliberate decision point where you're preserving a stable state for future reference, separate from the publishing/deployment step. This allows for the workflow where you checkpoint versions during development, run tests, do additional work, and then later publish the whole site when ready.




checkpoint, it's more understandable, but it doesn't capture the act of generating catalogs and bumping versions very well. 

I'm defining source as "a directory structure that corresponds to namespaces, thing identifiers, and datasets; plus assets, configuration, and metadata". Let me know any other verb-y terms for checkpoint or anything missing from source definition.

Edit
Alternative verbs for the version-creation process:

"On build" (.8) - captures the generation/construction aspect "On process" (.7) - generic but clear about active transformation "On generate" (.6) - emphasizes the catalog generation "On snapshot" (.7) - captures the preservation moment "On stage" (.6) - implies preparation for publishing "On compile" (.5) - borrowed from programming, might be confusing

For your source definition (.9), that covers the key components well. Possible additions:

"Source: A directory structure that corresponds to namespaces, thing identifiers, and datasets; plus assets, templates, configuration, and metadata"

Templates - since you mentioned template engines like Vento/JSX
Import mappings - rules for bringing in external data
Build scripts - automation for the generation process
"On build" feels most natural (.8) since it captures both the version bumping AND the catalog generation that happens during the SSG process. It's also familiar terminology from software development workflows.

What's your intuition about which verb best captures the "analyze changes, bump versions, generate catalogs" workflow?




but build is what you do to a site. weave has more flow, and it's more like pre-processing before the site build happens.

Edit
Perfect (.9) - "weave" captures the flow aspect beautifully and distinguishes it from the site build process.


Semantic Flow & IRI Schema Context Summary
Document ∙ Version 18 
"Weave" is perfect (.9) - it suggests:

Flow and integration - bringing together disparate data sources
Pre-processing - happens before the site build
Transformation - raw source becomes structured versions
Semantic richness - weaving together the semantic web
The workflow becomes:

Edit source content
Weave - analyze changes, version datasets, generate catalogs
Build - create the static site from woven structure
Publish - deploy to GitHub Pages
"Weave" captures that crucial middle step where the semantic-flow magic happens - turning your source into a properly versioned, cataloged knowledge graph ready for site generation (.8).




Weave also includes minting new IRIs.
Edit
Perfect addition (.9) - minting new IRIs is definitely part of the weave process.

The complete weave workflow:

Analyze source content changes
Mint new IRIs for newly referenced entities/concepts
Version datasets that contain changed data
Generate catalogs with discovery metadata
Prepare structured output for site build
Weave becomes the semantic processing layer (.8) that:

Discovers new entities mentioned in datasets
Assigns them appropriate namespace locations
Creates their identifier structure
Links them into the knowledge graph
Versions all the data appropriately
This makes weave much more semantically rich - it's not just versioning existing data, but actively expanding and organizing the knowledge graph by minting stable identifiers for new concepts as they emerge (.9).

The LLM-assisted entity situating you mentioned earlier would be part of this IRI minting process during weave.




okay, let's call the artifact that gets woven a "semantic mesh"

I wouldn't exactly say "expanding and organizing", we're just giving things in the graph persistent names and indexes/catalogs.

Edit
Perfect (.9) - "semantic mesh" captures the interconnected nature of the source structure before it gets woven into the final versioned form.


Semantic Flow & IRI Schema Context Summary
Document ∙ Version 19 
You're right about the terminology (.8) - "expanding and organizing" overstates what's happening. Weave is more about:

What weave actually does:

Persistent naming - giving things in the graph stable IRIs
Indexing - creating catalogs for discovery
Versioning - preserving data states immutably
The semantic mesh already contains the knowledge graph structure - weave just formalizes it with proper identifiers and makes it navigable through catalogs. Much more precise description (.7).

The "mesh" metaphor works well too - it suggests an interconnected structure that gets woven into something more formal and permanent.




Architecture-wise, we want an API that contains all the operations you can define on a semantic flow, and a CLI that's a thin wrapper on that API. The API should perhaps be a self-contained service with a sqlite or similar backend. or maybe an embedded RDF store. So the service can run locally, for access by tools or web interface, or on a server for publicly exposing the operations. Does that make sense? Is there good middleware that allows Cliffy or similar to use an API service for its functionality? The service can also do filesystem monitoring so for large semantic meshes, the system can be ready to go instead of having to compute everything at weave time.

Edit
That architecture makes excellent sense (.9) - it provides maximum flexibility and performance while keeping concerns properly separated.

API-first architecture benefits:

Tool integration - IDEs, scripts, web UIs can all use same API
Local/remote flexibility - same service works standalone or networked
Performance - persistent state eliminates re-computation
Monitoring - filesystem watching enables reactive updates
For CLI → API integration (.8):

Cliffy with fetch - Cliffy CLI can make HTTP calls to local API service
OpenAPI spec - auto-generate CLI commands from API definitions
Service discovery - CLI checks for local service, falls back to direct mode
Shared config - API and CLI use same configuration files
Storage options (.7):

SQLite + RDF extensions - lightweight, embedded, SQL queries
Embedded triple stores - Oxigraph (Rust), SurrealDB with graph features
Hybrid - SQLite for metadata/indexes, separate RDF store for actual data
Filesystem monitoring (.8) enables:

Incremental weaving - only process changed files
Hot reloading - web interface updates live as you edit
Dependency tracking - know which catalogs need regeneration
Service architecture:

semantic-flow-api (HTTP service)
├── RDF store backend  
├── Filesystem watcher
├── Weave engine
└── Catalog generator

sf-cli (thin wrapper)
└── HTTP client → API calls
This feels like the right level of modularity (.9).

create_directory

read_file


The file exists but only contains the Dendron frontmatter - no conversation content yet. Let me write our entire conversation to that file in manageable chunks. I'll append to the existing file:

read_file


I can see the file exists with Dendron metadata. I'll append our conversation content to it. Would you like me to proceed with writing the full conversation content, or would you prefer a different approach given the length?
