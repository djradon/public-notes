- aka: improv

**Improvisational theater** (often called **improv**) is a form of theater where most or all of the performance is **unscripted** and created spontaneously by the actors. The performers typically invent dialogue, characters, and plotlines on the spot, often based on audience suggestions. The key is creativity, quick thinking, and collaboration.

### Examples of Improv:

1. **Whose Line Is It Anyway?** – A popular improv TV show where comedians perform spontaneous skits based on prompts.
2. **The Second City** – A famous improv comedy theater in Chicago that has produced many notable comedians.
3. **Improv Everywhere** – A group that stages spontaneous performances in public spaces.
