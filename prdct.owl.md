## description:

- OWL 2 ontologies themselves are primarily exchanged as RDF documents
- OWL-Lite is the least expressive sub-langauge. OWL-Full is the most expressive sub-language. The expressiveness of OWL-DL falls between that of OWL-Lite and OWL-Full. 
 
## Highlights

- OWL ontologies can use the preexisting OWL attribute owl:versionInfo to store version information.
