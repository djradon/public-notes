## Purpose

This vault is the "[[learning-in-public|ar.swyx.learn-in-public]]" part of my Second Brain. It includes:

- [[t]] my personal wikipedia
- [[idea]] (not necessarily mine)
- "resource notes", including highlights, thoughts and metadata, for various things:
  - [[ar]] mostly articles and documentation
  - [[book]]
  - [[community]]
  - [[course]]
  - [[event]]
  - [[game]]
  - [[loc]]
  - [[org]]
  - [[user]]
  - [[prdct]]
  - [[recipe]]
  - [[videos: movies, tv episodes, etc|video]]
- [[vs]]
- [[wanted]]
- [[tags]] which may refer to any and multiple (or none) of the above

In terms of the [[t.km.zettelkasten]] method, this wiki is a commingling of literature notes with something Ahrens warned about: a "personal Wikipedia or a database" [^1]. 

In terms of [[t.tm.getting-things-done]], it's references, someday-maybe, next actions, and public projects


### Different

- evergreen-notes/digital-garden: for "synthesized" / original-ish publishable big-idea notes that should evolve over time, props to @andy-matuschak
- blog: for "point-in-time" items to be shared: personal news, articles 
  - e.g., [[ar.substack.carpe-noctem]]
- private notes
