## Purpose

This vault is the "[[learning-in-public|ar.swyx.learn-in-public]]" part of my Second Brain. It includes:

- [[topics: my personal wikipedia|t]]
- [[ideas|idea]] (not necessarily mine)
- "resource notes", including highlights, thoughts and metadata, for various things:
  - [[addressable resources|ar]] mostly articles and documentation
  - [[books|book]]
  - [[communities|community]]
  - [[courses|course]]
  - [[event]]
  - [[games|game]]
  - [[locations|loc]]
  - [[organizations|org]]
  - [[people|user]]
  - [[products|prdct]]
  - [[recipes|recipe]]
  - [[videos: movies, tv episodes, etc|video]]
- [[comparisons|vs]]
- [[desiderata|wanted]]
- [[tags|tags]] which may refer to any and multiple (or none) of the above

In terms of the [[t.km.zettelkasten]] method, this wiki is a commingling of literature notes with something Ahrens warned about: a "personal Wikipedia or a database" [^1]. 

In terms of [[t.tm.getting-things-done]], it's references, someday-maybe, next actions, and public projects


### [[p.differentFrom]]

- evergreen-notes/digital-garden: for "synthesized" / original-ish publishable big-idea notes that should evolve over time, props to @andy-matuschak
- blog: for "point-in-time" items to be shared: personal news, articles 
- predicates: a public enumeration of useful properties
- private-notes: 
  - "fleeting notes", journal entries
  - INBOX
  - personal 
    - task management
    - project management
    - project/product ideas
    - inventory management
  - non-public people notes
  - experimentation
- archive: for old task, projects, and other junk
  - maybe not necessary?
