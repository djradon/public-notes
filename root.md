Welcome! And beware!  

## Purpose

This vault is the "[[learning-in-public|ar.swyx.learn-in-public]]" part of my Second Brain. If you share some of my interests, please [reach out](https://djradon.github.io)! 

## Contents

- [[t]] my personal wikipedia
- [[idea]] (not necessarily mine)
- Resource Notes, including highlights, thoughts and metadata, for various things:
  - [[ar]] mostly articles, papers and web pages
  - [[book]]
  - [[community]]
  - [[course]]
  - [[event]]
  - [[game]]
  - [[loc]]
  - [[org]]
  - [[user]] 
  - [[prdct]] mostly software products, but also ontologies
  - [[recipe]]
  - [[video]] movies, tv episodes, youtube, etc
- [[vs]]
- [[wanted]]
- Some "Metadata Notes":
  - [[tags]] which may refer to any and multiple (or none) of the above
  - [[c]]: ways to categorize resources
  - [[p]]: ways to assert things about resources (mostly abandoned)

In terms of the [[t.km.zettelkasten]] method, this wiki is a commingling of literature notes with something @SÃ¶nke-Ahrens warned about: a "personal Wikipedia or a database" [^1]. 

In terms of [[t.tm.getting-things-done]], it's references, someday-maybe, next actions, and public projects.

## Beware!

This is a cluttered cupboard of jumbled jottings riddled with inaccuracies, confusion, and mistakes.

## What This Is Not

- evergreen-notes/digital-garden: for "synthesized" / original-ish publishable big-idea notes that should evolve over time, props to @andy-matuschak and @maggie-appleton
- blog: for "point-in-time" items to be shared: personal news, articles, etc.
  - e.g., [[ar.substack.carpe-noctem]]
