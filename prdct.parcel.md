## Features

-   üòç **Zero config** ‚Äì Parcel supports many languages and file types out of the box, from web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to assets like images, fonts, videos, and more. It has a built-in dev server with hot reloading, beautiful error diagnostics, and much more. No configuration needed!
-   ‚ö°Ô∏è **Lightning fast** ‚Äì Parcel's JavaScript compiler is written in Rust for native performance. Your code is built in parallel using worker threads, utilizing all of the cores on your machine. Everything is cached, so you never build the same code twice. It's like using watch mode, but even when you restart Parcel!
-   üöÄ **Automatic production optimization** ‚Äì Parcel optimizes your whole app for production automatically. This includes tree-shaking and minifying your JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, resizing and optimizing images, content hashing, automatic code splitting, and much more.
-   üéØ **Ship for any target** ‚Äì Parcel automatically transforms your code for your target environments. From modern and legacy browser support, to zero config JSX and TypeScript compilation, Parcel makes it easy to build for any target ‚Äì or many!
-   üåç **Scalable** ‚Äì Parcel requires zero configuration to get started. But as your application grows and your build requirements become more complex, it's possible to extend Parcel in just about every way. A simple configuration format and powerful plugin system that's designed from the ground up for performance means Parcel can support projects of any size.
