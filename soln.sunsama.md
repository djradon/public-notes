Elegant, guided solution to time and task management with decent integrations and an opinionated but human approach; but ultimately, isn't it a walled garden?

## features

- tells me how much work I did (assuming you account for everything)
  - but ultimately these days, I just work all day
- encourages planning and reflection
  - but [[ar.aaronlynn.how-to-set-up-your-personal-task-management-system]] can support it in a more flexible way
- syncs with multiple Jira instances

## personal fit

- pulling in all the schedules is good, but Google Calendar can do that
- if I cancel a Sunsama task, it just disappears
