## Abstract

Storing the theory of a particular subject area in one place and maintaining it (including formalization) through collective efforts is easily possible with the modern development of technology. The concentration and verification of knowledge achieved in this case should give a powerful ordering of theoretical knowledge, which will facilitate their formalization, i.e. mathematical notation, and therefore algorithmic processing in many cases, up to the semi-automatic proof of various kinds of consequences, for example, theorems. This message describes what the framework of the theory is, intended for unified storage and collective accumulation of its results.

## Issues

### UGraph

- @alex-shkotin: Let me propose to keep it in a knowledge hub form of framework. Like for ugraph theory [[here|ar.theory-framework-knowledge-hub-message-1]].  Today when we have GenAI as an alternative knowledge concentrator we at least know that it is possible to put ALL our theoretical knowledge in one "computer".

- @john-sowa: No, no, no absolutely NOT!   Only a tiny fraction of logicians have ever seen ugraph.

Only until there is a formal translation to and from FOL, we have ZERO evidence that ugraph is precise and reliable.  And if anybody can demonstrate that such a translation is possible, then that is a proof that we don't need ugraph.  We can continue to use FOL.

But there is also a standard for the superset of FOL called DOL, which is an official standard of the Object Management Group.  For a summary of the [[prdct.distributed-ontology-modeling-and-specification-language-dol]] standard, see slides 8 to 12  of  https://jfsowa.com/talks/eswc.pdf .  That talk (with a subset of the slides) won the best presentation award at the 2020 European Semantic Web Conference.
