- [[p.hadPresenter]] @justin-murphy
- flywheel: creators -> community -> developers -> infrastructure -> creators
- a lot of top engineers don't want to be building skynet for a megacorp
- easier than ever to be an independent software developer
- creators still under-monetized
  - [[p.begsQuestion]] valuable to who?
  - creators are more like statesmen: provide cognitive, aesthetic and emotional
