## Issues

- more a "schema.org" ontology than a Protégé ontology. So I would probably rather call it a "schema" than an ontology, as we use little to no OWL, just RDFS. And we use the schema.org domainIncludes/rangeIncludes by default as well.
- without community, the software is pretty much pointless.
