- "Since the DBpedia 3.7 release, the ontology is a directed-acyclic graph, not a tree. Classes may have multiple superclasses, which was important for the mappings to schema.org. A taxonomy can still be constructed by ignoring all superclasses except the one that is specified first in the list and is considered the most important."
