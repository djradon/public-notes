## Description

- "a text based story with narrative style of literature and interactivity aided by static or sprite based visuals"
- "Early versions of this genre came in the form of Choose-Your-Own-Adventure like novels, told on paper which allows the reader to choose one of a few paths depending on their choice. They are often told in 2nd person, and provide the reader the sights and sounds of the environment so that they sense they are interacting with the world while making those choices." [^1]
- "closely compared to "video games" for the sake that its an interactive medium with cause, effect, and consequences. However, most of the IF community sees it as a literary narrative." [^1]

## Perspective

- "Some IF works dispense with second-person narrative entirely, opting for a first-person perspective ('I') or even placing the player in the position of an observer, rather than a direct participant. In some 'experimental' IF, the concept of self-identification is eliminated, and the player instead takes the role of an inanimate object, a force of nature, or an abstract concept; experimental IF usually pushes the limits of the concept and challenges many assumptions about the medium."
